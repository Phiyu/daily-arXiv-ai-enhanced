Unlike standard integration methods such as Runge--Kutta\nthat often encounter stiffness and accuracy issues, this formulation expands\nthe normalized Hubble function $E(z) = H(z)/H_0$ as a finite Chebyshev series.\nThe modified Friedmann equation is then enforced at selected\nChebyshev--Gauss--Lobatto points, converting the original nonlinear\ndifferential equation into a system of algebraic relations for the series\ncoefficients. This transformation yields exponentially convergent and\nnumerically stable solutions over the entire redshift domain, $0<z<z_{max}$,\neliminating the need for adaptive step-size control. We apply the method to two\nwidely studied $f(R)$ models, Hu--Sawicki and Starobinsky, and perform a\ncombined analysis using cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data and the Union~3.0\nsupernova compilation. The reconstructed expansion histories match observations\nto within $2\\sigma$ over $0 < z < 2$, producing best-fit parameters of\napproximately $(\\Omega_{m0}, H_0, \\Lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}}) \\simeq (0.29, 68,\n1.2\\text{--}2.5\\,H_0^2)$. These results indicates that both models reproduce\nthe observed late-time acceleration while permitting small geometric\ncorrections to $\\Lambda$CDM. Overall, the spectral Chebyshev method provides a\nprecise and computationally efficient framework for probing modified-gravity\ncosmologies in the precision-data era."}

Firstly, we assess the consistency of this compilation with\nCMB-Planck data and recent BAO results from the DESI collaboration. After\nconfirming minimal tension with CMB data, we perform a series of joint analyses\ncombining CMB data with the 2D~BAO compilation, as well as with several recent\nType Ia supernova (SNIa) samples. In all cases, we compare the constraining\npower of the 2D~BAO data with that of DESI~DR2 samples. Our results indicate\nthat combining 2D~BAO with CMB and SNIa data provides observational constraints\nthat are competitive with those obtained using DESI~DR2. Although the precision\nof DESI~DR2 results remains higher, as expected due to the more accurate 3D\nmeasurements, the 2D~BAO compilation yields strong constraints.

Due to these results, we conclude that this new 2D~BAO compilation\nis both robust and competitive in constraining cosmological parameters, and,\nimportantly, it does not exhibit significant tension with CMB measurements."}

After being accelerated at supernova remnant shocks, CRs propagate\nthrough the interstellar medium (ISM), establishing smooth large-scale\ndistributions and driving galactic outflows. The efficiency of this feedback is\ncontrolled by the effective transport speed of the CR population, which in turn\ndepends on the competition between CR-driven plasma instabilities and wave\ndamping processes that vary strongly with ISM phase. In cold, dense gas,\nion-neutral damping dominates, whereas in warm, diffuse environments, weaker\nnon-linear Landau damping prevails, leading to enhanced CR scattering and\nslower transport. To investigate these effects, we employ the moving-mesh code\nArepo and model CR transport using a two-moment description within the\nmultiphase ISM framework Crisp, which self-consistently computes CR diffusion\ncoefficients and transport velocities from coarse-grained plasma physics. The\nintrinsic CR diffusion coefficient depends inversely on the scattering rate of\nCRs and Alfv\\'en waves, covering 15 orders of magnitude. In contrast, we show\nthat the effective CR diffusion coefficient, which quantifies the propagation\nspeed of CRs through the ISM, converges toward the canonical range of\n$10^{28}$-$10^{29}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$. Simulations with only non-linear Landau\ndamping yield transport rates up to an order of magnitude slower than those\nincluding both Landau and ion-neutral damping. Overall, CR transport speeds\nincrease systematically with gas density, for which we provide a\ndensity-dependent fit of the effective CR diffusion coefficient. We demonstrate\nthat, despite strong ion-neutral damping in the cold and warm phases of the\ngalactic disk, CRs are transported at speeds only a few times the local\nAlfv\\'en speed as they traverse alternating ISM phases on their way out of the\ngalaxy."}

Considering potential cold gas sources in massive spirals, we\nargue that their current reservoirs likely originate from past starburst or\nmerger events rather than ongoing accretion in present isolated environments.\nFinally, we examine the location of these galaxies on the baryonic Tully-Fisher\nrelation, finding them baryon-deficient and deviating from the trend of\nlower-mass galaxies. This suggests either a significant undetected baryonic\ncomponent or a flattening/turnover of the relation at the high-mass end,\nconsistent with the stellar mass-halo mass relation."}

Maser compactness\nappears to be a strong function of Galactic position, with masers that are\nlikely in nearby spiral arms being more compact, while those associated with\ndistant arms or the central Galactic region being less compact - a relationship\nwe associate with scatter broadening. This has implications for astrophysical\nmasers, especially distant ones employed for Galactic astrometry."}

The $M_{\\rm bar} - R_{\\rm 50, bar}$ relation of LSD galaxies has a\nslope close to 2, pointing to a constant average surface density, whereas that\nof HSD galaxies has a slope close to 1, indicating that less massive spirals\nare progressively more compact.

The sensitive NOEMA imaging at\n1.6 kpc resolution reveals extended dust emission, ~14 kpc in diameter (r_e~2.5\nkpc, b/a=0.5), that is centrally asymmetric and clumpy. The dust emission is as\nextended as the stellar emission and the molecular gas traced by CO(2-1), with\na common center, and is brightest in the strongly-obscured nuclear part of the\ngalaxy. Approximately one-third of the total dust emission emerges from the\nnucleus and the most prominent clump to the south, and (only) 60% from the\ncentral 3.5x1.5 kpc (0.5\"-0.2\"), implying that the starburst is very extended.\nThe combined JWST and NOEMA morphology suggests GN20 experienced a recent\ninteraction or merger, likely invigorating the starburst. The radial surface\nbrightness profiles of the molecular gas and near-IR stellar emission are\nsimilar, while in contrast, the dust emission appears significantly more\nconcentrated.

This paper\ninvestigates, for the first time, the influence of spacetime curvature on the\n(inverse) Gertsenshtein effect. To this end, we first determine the metric\nperturbation from Minkowski spacetime up to second order in the magnetic field\nstrength, assuming cylindrical symmetry.

Our analysis reveals that two competing effects govern the\namplitude evolution: magnification due to the focusing of waves by spacetime\ncurvature, and attenuation due to wave conversion via the Gertsenshtein effect.\nIn the plane wave case, these effects precisely cancel, resulting in no net\nchange in amplitude.

However, we observe an\napparent correlation between the inferred effective inspiral spin and the\nloudness of the gravitational-wave events-- loud events typically have\nclose-to-zero effective spins whereas fainter events tend to be inferred with\nrelatively arbitrary effective spins. Through simulations, we demonstrate that\nnon-negligible effective spins can be systematically inferred from non-spinning\nsystems at small signal strengths. These two observations support the\npossibility that the effective spin magnitudes in the observable compact\nbinaries are generally small. Future detections can have potential impact on\nthe understanding of their population and other astrophysical inferences."}

The robustness of\nthe arm-locking control loop is crucial for maintaining laser frequency\nstability, which directly impacts the accuracy of gravitational-wave\nmeasurements. In this work, a parametric stability analysis framework is\ndeveloped by combining the D-subdivision theory with the Semi-Discretization\nmethod to map the stability regions of arm-locking systems in the parameter\nspace and identify their critical stability boundaries. Based on the\nfrequency-domain characteristics, a robust arm-locking controller is designed\nto enhance loop stability under parameter perturbations. Theoretical analysis\nand time-domain simulations confirm that the proposed controller maintains\nclosed-loop stability and realize suppression of laser frequency noise against\nparameter perturbation."}

This motivates directional searches for astrophysical and\ncosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds, as well as continuous-wave\nemitters. We present results of such a search using data from the first\nobserving run through the first portion of the fourth observing run of the\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations. We apply gravitational-wave radiometer\ntechniques to generate skymaps and search for both narrowband and broadband\npersistent gravitational-wave sources. Additionally, we use spherical harmonic\ndecomposition to probe spatially extended sources. No evidence of persistent\ngravitational-wave signals is found, and we set the most stringent constraints\nto date on such emissions. For narrowband point sources, our sensitivity\nestimate to effective strain amplitude lies in the range $(0.03 - 8.4) \\times\n10^{-24}$ across all sky and frequency range $(20 - 160)$ Hz. For targeted\nsources -- Scorpius X-1, SN 1987A, the Galactic Center, Terzan 5, and NGC 6397\n-- we constrain the strain amplitude with best limits ranging from $\\sim 1.1\n\\times 10^{-25}$ to $6.5 \\times 10^{-24}$. For persistent broadband sources, we\nconstrain the gravitational-wave flux $F_{\\alpha, \\hat{n}}^{95\\%,\n\\mathrm{UL}}(25\\, \\mathrm{Hz}) < (0.008 - 5.5) \\times 10^{-8}\\, \\mathrm{erg\\,\ncm^{-2}\\, s^{-1}\\, Hz^{-1}}$, depending on the sky direction $\\hat{n}$ and\nspectral index $\\alpha=0,\\,2/3,\\,3$.

A critical technical challenge is\nmitigating tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling noise, which is expected to be the\nthird dominant noise source after laser frequency and clock noises. This noise\nis unavoidable in the presence of the residual angular movement of satellites,\nmovable optical subassemblies (MOSAs), and test masses (TMs), and needs to be\nsubtracted after reducing the first two types of noises using time-delay\ninterferometry (TDI). Previous works have shown that TTL coupling coefficients\ncan be estimated from the null TDI channel $\\zeta$ and used for noise\nsubtraction in other combinations. However, it was found that correlated MOSA\nyaw jitters have a negative impact on the TTL calibration, and the effects of\nrealistic residual angular jitters from drag-free and pointing control (DFPC)\nare yet to be investigated. In this paper, we use closed-loop DFPC simulations\nto generate more realistic jitters in the science mode and test TTL calibration\ncapability. Our simulations reveal that rotating only one MOSA is more\nfavorable, compared to symmetrically rotating two MOSAs, for enhancing the\naccuracy of TTL coefficient estimation, while employing only high-frequency\ndata (0.1 - 1 Hz). Moreover, we propose two other methods to further improve\nestimation accuracy. Firstly, using different null channel combinations, such\nas $C_3^{14}$, enhances the least squares estimation accuracy even in the case\nof high correlations in MOSAs' yaw jitters. Secondly, injecting different\nsinusoidal artificial maneuvers to the six MOSAs also shows improvements. These\nmethods can help TianQin to meet the 0.3 pm/Hz$^{1/2}$ requirement after the\nTTL noise subtraction."}

The\nmass term induces non-negligible energy and pressures of the scalar field and\nleads to gravitational light deflection compatible with MOND-ian free fall\ntrajectories. In the weak field (Newton-Milgrom) approximation the Bekenstein\nterm implies a deep MOND equation for the scalar field. In this model the\nexternal field effect of the MOND approach has to be reconsidered. This has\nimportant consequences for hierarchical systems like clusters, which may\nsuffice for explaining their dynamics without additional dark matter."}

We consider both uncoupled and coupled cosmological\nscenarios. In the latter case, the coupling between phantom dark energy and\ndark matter is motivated by the warm inflationary paradigm, with the\ndissipation coefficient assumed to be either constant or variable. The\nevolution equations of our coupled and uncoupled cosmological models are\nwritten in the form of autonomous systems, whose stability is studied using\nmethods of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems. For this analysis, the\nonly requirement imposed on the phantom scalar-field potential is that a\nspecific dynamical variable, defined in terms of the potential and its\nderivative, must be invertible. We show that the uncoupled phantom cosmological\nmodel cannot accommodate any accelerated scaling solution, while such solutions\ndo exist in the coupled scenario, for both constant and variable dissipation\ncoefficients. Although there is a limitation to these scaling solutions $-$\nspecifically, the current stage of accelerated expansion is not preceded by a\nlong enough matter-dominated era $-$ our results show that the existence of a\ndirect coupling between phantom dark energy and dark matter yields great\npotential for addressing the cosmic coincidence problem."}

Such overlaps\ncan bias parameter estimation (PE) and mimic signatures of other physical\neffects, such as gravitational lensing. In this work, we investigate how\noverlapping signals can be degenerate with gravitational lensing by focusing on\ntwo scenarios: Type-II strong lensing and microlensing by an isolated\npoint-mass lens. We simulate quasicircular binary black-hole pairs with\nchirp-mass ratios $\\mathscr{M}_{\\rm B}/\\mathscr{M}_{\\rm A}\\in\\{0.5,\\,1,\\,2\\}$,\nSNR ratios $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\rm B}/\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\rm A}\\in\\{0.5,\\,1\\}$, and\ncoalescence-time offsets $\\Delta t_{\\rm c}\\in[-0.1,\\,0.1]~\\mathrm{s}$. Bayesian\nPE and fitting-factor studies show that the Type-II lensing hypothesis is\nfavored over the unlensed quasicircular hypothesis ($\\log_{10}\\mathscr{B}^{\\rm\nL}_{\\rm U}>1$) only in a small region of the overlapping parameter space with\n$\\mathscr{M}_{\\rm B}/\\mathscr{M}_{\\rm A}\\gtrsim1$ and $|\\Delta t_{\\rm\nc}|\\leq0.03~\\rm{s}$.. Meanwhile, false evidence for microlensing signatures can\narise because, to a reasonable approximation, the model produces two\nsuperimposed images whose time delay can closely match $|\\Delta t_{\\rm c}|$.\nOverall, the inferred Bayes factor depends on relative chirp-mass ratios,\nrelative loudness, difference in coalescence times, and also the absolute SNRs\nof the overlapping signals. Cumulatively, our results indicate that overlapping\nblack-hole binaries with nearly equal chirp masses and comparable loudness are\nlikely to be falsely identified as lensed. Such misidentifications are expected\nto become more common as detector sensitivities improve. While our study\nfocuses on ground-based detectors using appropriate detectability thresholds,\nthe findings naturally extend to next-generation GW observatories."}

Quadratic curvature extensions intended to probe ultraviolet physics\ngenerically propagate a massive spin-$2$ ghost and are therefore non-unitary.\nOne route to remove ghost is by enlarging the geometric sector (torsion,\nnon-metricity). We investigate the infrared phenomenology of both the standard\n(ghostful) and ghost-free fourth-order gravity theories by computing\nGravitational Wave (GW) emission and confronting the results with observations\nsuch as the orbital-period decay of quasi-stable binaries such as PSR B1913+16\nand PSR J1738+0333 and the chirp-mass evolution of GW170817. In the ghostful\ntheory, besides the theoretical inconsistency due to non-unitarity, there are\nalso phenomenological problems: the massless spin-$2$ GW flux cancels the\ncombined GW fluxes of the massive spin-$2$ ghost and massive spin-$0$ scalar in\nthe vanishing-mass limit, so the GR quadrupole formula is not recovered at the\nleading order. As a result, we obtain the GW constraint on the ghostful theory\nas $m\\gtrsim 10^{-11}~\\mathrm{eV}$, where $m$ is the mass of the massive modes.\nBy contrast, the ghost-free theory smoothly reproduces the Newtonian potential\nand GR quadrupole formulae when the two coupling constants $\\alpha_1$ and\n$\\alpha_2$ vanish, independently of the mass $m$. Therefore, GW observations\nput mass-dependent upper bounds on the size of the coupling constants. For\nexample, if we assume $\\alpha_1\\simeq\\alpha_2$ for simplicity, then we obtain\n$\\alpha_{1,2}\\lesssim 4.2\\times 10^{83}$ for $m\\sim 3\\times\n10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $\\alpha_{1,2}\\lesssim 1.3\\times 10^{75}$ for $m\\sim\n10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.

Unlike standard integration methods such as Runge--Kutta\nthat often encounter stiffness and accuracy issues, this formulation expands\nthe normalized Hubble function $E(z) = H(z)/H_0$ as a finite Chebyshev series.\nThe modified Friedmann equation is then enforced at selected\nChebyshev--Gauss--Lobatto points, converting the original nonlinear\ndifferential equation into a system of algebraic relations for the series\ncoefficients. This transformation yields exponentially convergent and\nnumerically stable solutions over the entire redshift domain, $0<z<z_{max}$,\neliminating the need for adaptive step-size control. We apply the method to two\nwidely studied $f(R)$ models, Hu--Sawicki and Starobinsky, and perform a\ncombined analysis using cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data and the Union~3.0\nsupernova compilation. The reconstructed expansion histories match observations\nto within $2\\sigma$ over $0 < z < 2$, producing best-fit parameters of\napproximately $(\\Omega_{m0}, H_0, \\Lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}}) \\simeq (0.29, 68,\n1.2\\text{--}2.5\\,H_0^2)$. These results indicates that both models reproduce\nthe observed late-time acceleration while permitting small geometric\ncorrections to $\\Lambda$CDM. Overall, the spectral Chebyshev method provides a\nprecise and computationally efficient framework for probing modified-gravity\ncosmologies in the precision-data era."}
