To appear in European Journal of Physics", "summary": "Black holes are some of the most interesting objects in the universe. While they first arise in the complicated behavior of general relativity, the physical laws ruling their behavior are surprisingly simple. For example, one of the core facts about black holes is that their area never decreases, much alike the entropy in thermodynamics. In this note directed at introductory physics students and their instructors, we use this similarity to understand properties of black hole physics using standard techniques from an undergraduate course in thermal physics. We explore the never-decreasing nature of black hole area to obtain bounds on the energy emitted in a black hole merger (a calculation originally done by Hawking). We show how this allows us to think of black holes in manners very similar to heat engines, and how these ideas have been used in modern gravitational wave observatories to test general relativity. This allows a research-level topic to be discussed in introductory physics lectures."}

Starting from standard Hartle--Hawking and tunneling boundary conditions, we emphasize that semiclassical WKB structure and inflationary squeezing do not by themselves yield classicality. Tracing over unobserved degrees of freedom and using the influence functional formalism, we derive the decoherence functional for superhorizon curvature modes during inflation. For a light massive environmental scalar field in the Bunch--Davies vacuum, we obtain an explicit noise kernel and show how a nonzero mass regulates the infrared behavior. We then evaluate decoherence under horizon-based and EFT-motivated coarse grainings, finding efficient suppression of interference between macroscopically distinct perturbation histories in both cases. The analysis clarifies the distinct roles of boundary conditions (branch amplitudes) and decoherence (classical branch selection) and yields an emergent cosmological arrow of time through environment-induced entanglement."}

Using the fully covariant vector boson formalism and covariant Maxwell theory, we derive an exact Schrödinger-type radial equation with a curvature-induced effective potential. Recasting the dynamics in Helmholtz form yields an effective refractive-index profile, showing that the wormhole acts as an inhomogeneous optical medium with position-dependent refractive index and frequency-dependent confinement, where low-frequency modes are strongly trapped while high-frequency modes propagate almost freely. A differential-geometric correspondence with helicoidal surfaces is established via $1/[a^2(1-η)] \\leftrightarrow w^2$, demonstrating that Lorentz-violation-induced curvature is mathematically equivalent to curvature generated by geometric twist and linking the model to twisted graphene nanoribbons as analog-gravity platforms.

Examining its behavior in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime reveals a mechanism in which the symmetry between energy and momentum is dynamically broken. Applying this concept naturally leads to the derivation of the familiar LCDM model, while simultaneously alleviating both the fine-tuning and coincidence problems. Comparison of the ground-state energy behavior in the Friedmann equations with a dust matter field further indicates that large-scale matter exhibits the same symmetry-breaking behavior. Remarkably, due to this broken symmetry, the interactions between local regions of matter in the large-scale structure generate effective pressure, driving late-time acceleration and reproducing the LCDM expansion history without invoking exotic fields or negative-pressure components. This framework provides a self-consistent realization of LCDM within General Relativity, emerging entirely from the intrinsic dynamics of standard matter without fine-tuning and coincidence problems."}

Using void catalogs from four Millennium Simulation snapshots and SDSS data at $z<0.04$, we perform a unified analysis of void demographics, galaxy properties, and internal kinematics. Our analysis reveals clear evidence that cosmic voids exhibit a significant evolutionary trend of becoming progressively emptier toward low redshift, accompanied by a marked decline in the brightness and clustering of their galaxy populations. The void galaxy luminosity function evolves significantly: $M^{*}$ fades and $α$ flattens with time, with large voids hosting brighter, more rapidly evolving galaxies than small voids. Stacked density profiles exhibit a universal shape when scaled by void radius, deepening and building more pronounced walls toward $z=0$. Galaxy spatial distributions reveal persistent size-dependent segregation, with galaxies in large voids lying farther from the center and more strongly clustered. Dynamical analysis of simulations shows coherent outward flows in all voids, with amplitudes decreasing toward $z=0$, providing a physical basis for observed redshift-space distortions. Comparison with SDSS broadly confirms these evolutionary trends but uncovers a non-zero central galaxy population in observed voids -- absent in $Λ$CDM predictions -- that may challenge current galaxy formation models in extreme underdensities. Future comparisons with additional simulations and deeper high-redshift surveys will provide stronger tests of $Λ$CDM in the most underdense regions."}

The influence of the quintessence state parameter $w_q$ and the matter--geometry coupling constant $χ$ on the geometry is analyzed. We examine the weak, null, and strong energy conditions, identifying the regions in the parameter space where they are satisfied. Furthermore, we apply the Hamilton--Jacobi method to study the tunneling of scalar particles across the event horizon and derive the corresponding Hawking temperature. The thermodynamic stability of the solutions is investigated by computing the heat capacity, and the conditions for phase transitions are discussed. The results provide a characterization of black strings in $f(R,T)$ gravity surrounded by quintessence, highlighting the combined effects of anisotropic matter and modified gravity on their physical properties."}

In particular, uncertainties in measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies, combined with modeling limitations, obfuscate the impact of supermassive black hole feedback across environments and over time. Here we address this with a comprehensive analysis of ~60,000 nearby AGNs (z < 0.15 and new environment and halo-mass measurements for ~500,000 AGN and non-AGN host galaxies. This benchmark enables unified comparisons with three prominent cosmological simulations--SIMBA, TNG, and EAGLE--and reveals major, contrasting shortcomings. Simulations fail to reproduce observed trends linking star formation, quiescence, AGN luminosity, stellar mass, and halo mass. While simulations qualitatively capture that AGNs are more common in low-mass halos than in rich groups or clusters, detailed host demographics diverge strongly from observations. Partial agreement exists in the stellar mass distribution within large-scale structures, yet all simulations overproduce quenched low-mass satellites in massive halos, while misrepresenting quenched fractions of massive central galaxies and those in low-density environments, which are sensitive to feedback implementation. Improved AGN physics and modeling of multi-phase gas cooling and flows are required to capture the observed interplay between black holes, galaxies, and halos."}

We mathematically prove two distinct, time-dependent signatures. First, the massless MOG scalar field induces a volumetric ``breathing mode'' polarization, causing the total apparent area of the shadow to rhythmically expand and contract. Second, the massive MOG vector field undergoes quantum vacuum dispersion, arriving at the observer with a predictable time delay. This delayed massive wave sources secondary longitudinal metric perturbations that manifest as a sudden, asymmetric translational wobble of the shadow on the celestial screen. These dynamic geometric shifts offer a robust observational template for next-generation interferometry to strictly test the existence of massive force carriers and scalar fields in gravity."}

These mergers, combined with feedback from AGN, filamentary accretion, and other energy injection processes, generate turbulence and perturbations within the intra-cluster medium (ICM). X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) observations can be utilized to measure these ICM density and pressure inhomogeneities, in turn providing constraints on the effective Equation of State (EOS) of the perturbations and ICM velocities. In this work, we analyze deep SRG-eROSITA and Planck/SPT observations of Abell 3266 (A3266), a dynamically complex merging cluster with elongated morphology and significant substructure. We measure pressure and density fluctuations, and compute the power spectra and deprojected 3D amplitudes of these perturbations. We estimate the ratio of pressure-to-density fluctuation amplitudes as $1.00 \\pm 0.55$ and non-thermal pressure support $0.068 \\pm 0.050$. Density fluctuations are found to be stronger in the northern sector of the cluster compared to the south, consistent with ongoing accretion along a filamentary structure revealed by eROSITA. Further, we find the amplitude of density fluctuations increases with radius, qualitatively consistent with the trend found in cosmological simulations. Uncertainties in our results are dominated by the relatively low sensitivity of current Planck/SPT data, suggesting that improvements in SZ data quality could substantially improve our understanding of ICM energy injection, transport, and dissipation from this technique."}

These results suggest that current star formation is concentrated in regions farther from galaxy centers than older stellar populations traced by the continuum, indicative of inside-out star formation. With a careful accounting of slit-loss corrections for ground-based measurements, we calculate nebular reddening and dust-corrected SFRs using the Balmer decrement (H$α$/H$β$) and Paschen-to-Balmer line ratios (Pa$α$/H$α$ and Pa$β$/H$α$), assuming the Milky Way extinction curve. On average, Paschen-derived reddening and SFRs agree with Balmer-derived values; however, two galaxies exhibit significantly higher Paschen reddening and four show significantly higher Paschen SFRs. We find that non-unity dust covering fractions bias the Balmer decrement toward less reddened OB associations, while decrements involving the Paschen lines are less affected by this bias. These results highlight the enhanced sensitivity of the Paschen lines to the most heavily obscured OB associations in $z\\sim2$ galaxies, particularly in galaxies with patchy dust geometries. Future studies using Paschen lines exclusively to measure nebular reddening will yield more robust constraints on the dustiest star-forming regions."}

Next, building on Picard-Lefschetz techniques, we derive the full refractive expansion to arbitrary order, organising it into a transseries. Near caustics, the standard transseries is supplemented with uniform asymptotics. We study this transseries, with both Borel and hyperasymptotic resummation yielding systematic approximations to lensing integrals at all frequencies. Our results give a framework for modelling wave optics lensing near caustics and beyond the geometric optics approximation and thereby illustrate how tools from resurgence and asymptotic analysis can be applied to practical problems in astrophysics.\n  Near caustic singularities, the post-refractive corrections diverge, while the uniform asymptotic expansion becomes accurate.

We systematically investigate the influence of various parameters on the energy extraction process, comparing the results in two distinct regions: the circular orbit region and the plunging region. {The results reveal that the Lorentz-violating parameter has a significant impact on energy extraction, affecting not only the parameter space where energy extraction is possible, but also the energy extraction power and efficiency.} It is found that the energy extraction process in the circular orbit region can offer a promising avenue for constraining KR gravity. In contrast, although energy extraction from the plunging region remains feasible even for black holes with relatively low spins and takes place nearer to the event horizon, its sensitivity to the Lorentz-violating parameter is significantly reduced. Overall, the Comisso-Asenjo magnetic reconnection mechanism can serve as a probe of the KR field, particularly through the energy extraction process in the circular orbit region."}

Correlations between the quadrupole moments are discussed, where the correlations between pulsar pairs over the full sky are taken into account. The correlations turn out to be in the form of a three-dimensional traceless matrix with rank 2 that can be closely related with a projection tensor for the GW. Thereby, we demonstrate that the rank-2 matrix allows to estimate the DOA of the GW. In expectation of the forthcoming Square Kilometer Array, angular resolutions as well as DOA estimation errors are also examined."}

By applying a kernel-based analysis of density and velocity fluctuations, we map the turbulence driving parameter, b, which characterises the balance between solenoidal ($b\\sim0.3$) and compressive ($b\\sim1$) turbulent driving regimes. b is quantified as the ratio of the turbulent density fluctuations relative to the turbulent sonic Mach number, M. Both galaxies show predominantly solenoidal driving on average for the regions where we find valid results ($b\\geq 0.33(\\pm 0.05)^{+0.14}_{-0.10}$ in NGC7793; $b\\geq 0.24(\\pm 0.03)^{+0.10}_{-0.07}$ in NGC1313), noting that this is without including the influences of magnetic fields, making these measurements lower limits. We find substantial spatial variation of b, including localised regions of strongly compressive driving. NGC1313 exhibits higher turbulent Mach numbers and density dispersions than NGC7793, consistent with the disturbed morphology and recent satellite interaction in NGC1313. The turbulence in both NGC7793 and NGC1313 is supersonic ($3\\lesssim M\\lesssim 20$), and NGC1313 shows a radially decreasing trend of M with galactocentric radius. Radial trends indicate more solenoidal driving in the galaxy centres, potentially reflecting enhanced shear, and increasingly compressive modes in the outskirts. These results demonstrate that turbulence driving varies systematically with galactic environment and cannot be assumed uniform across discs. Our study applies a previously established method to larger scales and new data, linking local turbulence physics to global star formation regulation in galaxies, providing a new avenue for testing theoretical models with future integral field units and ALMA surveys."}

To our surprise, this effort led to the discovery of GW070605, what at first appeared to be a previously unreported high significance binary neutron star merger at a time when only the Livingston detector (L1) was operating -- data that could not have been analyzed and a signal that could not have been discovered previously because the algorithms of the day required coincidence between two or more detectors. GW070605's end time occurs in LIGO's L1 detector at 2007-06-05 18:37:02 UTC, and is estimated to be a merger with component masses of 1.82$M_\\odot$ and 1.24$M_\\odot$. The GstLAL detection algorithm estimates that noise processes produce false positives at least as significant as GW070605 at a rate of $8.6\\times10^{-10}$ per year. Disappointingly, subsequent investigations revealed the presence of a previously undocumented hardware injection in the L1 detector's Y arm end test mass' excitation channel, whose time and properties match that of GW070605. The injection does not appear in the Gravitational Wave Open Science Center list of hardware injections. We determined that while there is no sensitivity improvement between GstLAL and previous algorithms at the null-result threshold, there is marked improvement at above null-result thresholds; specifically, an approximately 55-times detection rate increase from initial-era algorithms at a FAR threshold of 1 per 7000 years."}

We derive the full field equations, the exact dark-sector exchange structure, and the linear scalar-perturbation system in gauge-ready form. In the sub-horizon regime, we derive effective modified-gravity functions governing structure growth and light deflection, and show that the model generically produces correlated, scale- and time-dependent departures from General Relativity in growth and lensing observables. Building on this structure, we formulate a perturbation-focused multi-probe framework based on redshift-space distortions, weak lensing, and CMB lensing, explicitly targeting degeneracy breaking beyond background-expansion tests. The analysis establishes the action-level and perturbation-level foundations of the model and provides a conservative, reproducible framework for translated linear-regime constraints within a dark-sector selective modified-gravity setting."}

Invited and accepted by Universe", "summary": "We revisit the extensively debated star-forming main sequence (SFMS)-a tight correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass in both kiloparsec-resolved and integrated galaxies. We statistically explore the fundamental drivers of star formation at global scales, using a large volume-limited sample of 24,954 local star-forming galaxies to overcome the limitations of previous works. Based on the mid-infrared 12 micron luminosity, stellar mass, and g-r color, we estimate the molecular gas mass for the considered sample. At galaxy-wide scales, we establish global relations between the surface densities of the star formation rate, stellar mass, and molecular gas mass . These global density relations are connected with and follow similar trends as the resolved SFMS, the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, and the molecular gas main sequence (MGMS). Taking advantage of this large catalog, we show that the scatters in the global KS and MGMS relations are smaller than that of the global relation between the star formation rate surface density and stellar mass surface density, and their Pearson correlation coefficients are higher. More importantly, multivariate regression and partial correlation analyses demonstrate that the apparent correlation between the star formation rate surface density and stellar mass surface density is entirely mediated by the molecular gas surface density, with its best-fit parameters directly derivable from those of the KS and MGMS relations. Overall, our findings suggest that the correlation between stellar mass and molecular gas, as well as that between molecular gas and star formation, are more direct and fundamental. The star-forming main sequence thus appears to be a natural by-product of these two tighter relations."}

When accounting for our present uncertainty on the suppression of the non-linear matter power spectrum through baryon feedback, we find that the error on the composite parameter $S_8=σ_8\\sqrt{Ω_{\\rm m}/0.3}$ almost doubles compared to an LSST analysis which neglects this astrophysical phenomenon. After the first year of observations, LSST will extend beyond the magnitude limit of existing representative spectroscopic calibration samples, requiring photometric redshifts to be calibrated using an alternative strategy. Adopting literature measurements of the reduced redshift calibration precision found from galaxy cross-correlation techniques, combined with current levels of baryon feedback uncertainty, we forecast final year LSST cosmic shear constraints that barely improve upon the first year analysis. This forecast therefore serves as encouragement to the community to develop methodology and observations to constrain models of baryon feedback and enhance photometric redshift calibration at depths where spectroscopy is unrepresentative. With tight priors on both these systematic terms, we forecast that LSST cosmic shear can deliver constraints on $S_8$ that are more than five times as constraining as existing cosmic shear surveys."}

We present mid-infrared light curves of NGC 6447 in 3.5$μ$m and 4.6 $μ$m bands observed by WISE/NEOWISE, which show an almost monotonic increasing trend of 1.2 mag over 14 years. The optical light curve from ASAS-SN during the same period is consistent with a constant showing no variability. The mid-infrared color evolution shows that the galaxy transitioned into an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in 2018. The SPHEREx spectrum reveals an increasing continuum resembling warm to hot dust emission from an AGN. NuSTAR detected an X-ray source with a 2-30 keV luminosity of $8.4\\times10^{41}$ ergs/s at the lower boundary of AGN X-ray emission range, and a factor of >7 variability in one year compared to the Swift upper limit. NGC 6447 was classified as a quiescent galaxy in the literature. The multi-wavelength timing and spectral properties of NGC 6447 are consistent with the expected AGN turning on event, where the obscuring material around the AGN central engine is gradually dispersed, revealing the central engine. This example shows that long-term infrared variability can be a powerful tool to find similar sources. Based on the sample selection statistics, we estimate the duration of the episodes of AGN accretion (duty cycle) signified by the turning-on event as $10^4$-$10^6$ yr."}

Yet direct observational evidence of the dependence of star formation activity on distance to filaments remains scarce and is missing at z>1. We investigate how starburst, main-sequence (MS), and quenched galaxies are distributed with respect to cosmic web filaments, and how this distribution evolves with redshift. We first use the SIMBA cosmological simulation to predict the redshift evolution of the mean distance to the closest filament from z=3 to z=0 for different galaxy populations after removing stellar-mass dependencies. We then measure the corresponding signal in the COSMOS field, using COSMOS2020 and COSMOS-Web data, where accurate photometric redshifts enable reconstruction of the projected cosmic web from z=2 to z=0.5, and starbursts are identified through far-infrared spectral energy distribution fitting. In agreement with the results from SIMBA, starburst galaxies are found closer to filaments at z>1 and at larger distances at z<1, MS galaxies occupy intermediate environments with little evolution, and quenched galaxies show progressively shorter distances to filaments toward low redshift, with a crossing between starburst and MS populations around z~1. In COSMOS-Web, the relative evolution in the average distance to filaments between starburst and MS galaxies is detected at a significance level of at least 5σ. We show that a minimal toy model in which the only environmental ingredient is the sSFR-filament distance modulation measured in simulations is sufficient to reproduce the observed differential evolution of the average filament distance between starburst and MS galaxies. These results show that the imprint of large-scale environmental effects on the star formation activity of galaxies, predicted by simulations, is detectable from z=2 down to z=0.5."}

We test its viability on cosmological scales using simulations with $256^{3}$ particles in a box of size $800/h$ comoving Mpc.

We also explore a local void solution to the Hubble tension in these models. Analogues to the observed \"Local Hole'' do form in the MOND models, but values for the deceleration parameter $<-1.5$ in these regions prevent a satisfactory resolution to the Hubble tension. Whilst $Λ$CDM significantly underpredicts the observed bulk flow in Cosmicflows-4, the high peculiar velocities that arise in the MOND models create the opposite problem, ruling out $ν$HDM at $>5σ$ confidence. Observations clearly require a much milder enhancement to the rate of structure growth in $Λ$CDM than is provided by the $ν$HDM paradigm. Our results also suggest that replacing cold dark matter with hot dark matter is unlikely to provide a viable cosmological model, regardless of the gravity law."}

Observational studies of this phase in dwarfs remain rare. We present a high-resolution study of the merger remnant VCC 693 in the outskirts of Virgo cluster, using observations from the Atomic gas in Virgo Interacting Dwarf galaxies (AVID) project. We explore the origin of VCC 693 and the consequences of the merger on its star formation and structure through a joint analysis of VLA and FAST HI emission line observations, together with complementary optical imaging and spectroscopy. We employ hydrodynamical simulations to help interpret the observations. Our analysis favours a near-major merger between two dwarfs with a stellar mass ratio of 3:1-4:1, with one likely gas-poor progenitor (i.e., a damp merger). The optical appearance of VCC 693 is dominated by complex tidal structures throughout the system, whereas the HI gas has settled to a regular rotating disk. Compared with similar-mass dwarfs, the central star formation and gas-phase metallicity are moderately enhanced. The global star formation rate, HI gas content, and HI-to-optical size ratio of VCC 693 are broadly consistent with those of typical dwarfs of similar mass, albeit somewhat lower. Decomposition of the HI rotation curve into baryonic and dark matter indicates a high halo concentration, suggesting post-merger relaxation into a more centrally peaked configuration. Together with two recent studies of AVID post-merger systems, these results support the view that even major dwarf mergers can produce remnants with overall stellar structures indistinguishable from ordinary dwarfs, and that the environmental effects in cluster outskirts can promote damp or mixed mergers, constituting an integral part of galactic pre-processing."}

Within the Teo wormhole ansatz with unit lapse and Morris-Thorne shape function, we solve analytically for the frame-dragging function and obtain a two-parameter family of asymptotically flat solutions labelled by the throat radius $r_0$ and total angular momentum $J$. Curvature scalars and stress-energy components are given in closed form, showing a regular throat, equatorial reflection symmetry, and violations of all standard energy conditions, as required for traversable wormholes. We analyse the causal structure and show that, despite the presence of an ergoregion for sufficiently large $|J|$, the coordinate time defines a global temporal function, so the spacetime is stably causal and free of closed timelike curves. The optical appearance is studied via photon trajectories. The resulting shadows are smaller than Kerr's and depend on the wormhole shape. Finally, we compute the Geroch-Hansen multipole moments and find a massless but spinning configuration with distinctive higher multipoles that encode the throat scale."}

In particular, uncertainties in measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies, combined with modeling limitations, obfuscate the impact of supermassive black hole feedback across environments and over time. Here we address this with a comprehensive analysis of ~60,000 nearby AGNs (z < 0.15 and new environment and halo-mass measurements for ~500,000 AGN and non-AGN host galaxies. This benchmark enables unified comparisons with three prominent cosmological simulations--SIMBA, TNG, and EAGLE--and reveals major, contrasting shortcomings. Simulations fail to reproduce observed trends linking star formation, quiescence, AGN luminosity, stellar mass, and halo mass. While simulations qualitatively capture that AGNs are more common in low-mass halos than in rich groups or clusters, detailed host demographics diverge strongly from observations. Partial agreement exists in the stellar mass distribution within large-scale structures, yet all simulations overproduce quenched low-mass satellites in massive halos, while misrepresenting quenched fractions of massive central galaxies and those in low-density environments, which are sensitive to feedback implementation. Improved AGN physics and modeling of multi-phase gas cooling and flows are required to capture the observed interplay between black holes, galaxies, and halos."}

We present a comprehensive investigation into the effectiveness and limitations of QU-fitting within the ASKAP POSSUM survey frequency ranges (800-1088 MHz and 1296-1440 MHz) with projections to other spectro-polarimetric radio observations. We simulate different physical polarization sources: Faraday simple, Burn slab, internal turbulence, external turbulence, and two-component models in the POSSUM frequencies, and assess their observational degeneracies and fit accuracies. Our results highlight the model-dependent nature of reliable fitting and identify specific regions of parameter space where model selection, and therefore characterization of the physical medium, becomes ambiguous. For QU-fitting we find the Bayes factor, computed using the marginal likelihood, outperforms more traditionally used goodness-of-fit metrics such as Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and chi-squared for model selection. We provide empirical relationships to delineate the boundaries where model distinguishability is impossible. Finally, we evaluate how accurately QU-fitting recovers model parameters and their associated uncertainties, thereby assessing its ability to correctly characterize the Faraday-rotating medium in both point and extended sources in Faraday depth space."}

Recent studies show that some PBHs can survive to the present epoch by gaining angular momentum through Hawking radiating photons and becoming extremal before complete evaporation. While this provides a plausible model in a two-derivative theory of gravity, additional issues arise in EFT-corrected theories of gravity. In such theories, a rapidly spinning black hole can lead to extremely high tidal forces on a near-horizon observer, with possible observational consequences. In this work, by modeling Hawking radiation as a biased random walk within an EFT of gravity, we show that nearly the same fraction of PBHs survives as in GR. We argue that the resultant near horizon tidal effects should be detectable in future gravitational-wave observables."}

Using MeerKAT radio continuum observations, we discover polarized emission only in a small fraction of its tail, with an average fraction of $~10\\%$, and a low Mach number $\\mathcal{M}=1.3-1.6$, which suggests a possible association between magnetic field draping, shock-compression of the gas, and extraplanar star formation activity.

Comments welcome", "summary": "Dust grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) actively contribute to the thermodynamics, chemistry, and radiative state of the interstellar medium (ISM), yet most ISM models and galaxy simulations either exclude them altogether or adopt simplified treatments. We present CALIMA, a new module for dust and PAH formation and evolution in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations for RAMSES, designed to self-consistently couple dust physics to radiative transfer and non-equilibrium thermochemistry in a multiphase ISM. The model employs a two-size, two-composition dust framework with log-normal grain populations, explicitly evolving stellar dust injection, turbulence-informed gas-phase accretion, shattering, coagulation, thermal and non-thermal sputtering, and shock destruction, while PAHs are separate components with their own evolution. The evolving dust populations and radiation field determine local, wavelength-dependent opacities, photoelectric heating efficiencies, grain-assisted recombination, dust-gas collisional heating/cooling, and H$_2$ formation on both grains and PAHs. Updated treatments of thermal sputtering and collisional cooling that include finite grain sizes and modern ion-solid physics reduce sputtering rates at high temperatures and extend the regime where dust significantly cools hot gas. One-zone ISM tests show that dust and PAH evolution modifies classical thermal phase diagrams and C-bearing chemistry, while isolated disc galaxy simulations reveal environment-dependent variations in dust-to-metal ratio, small-to-large grain ratio, PAH fraction, and interstellar radiation field intensity that drive non-trivial structure in infrared emission, UV transparency, and H$_2$ formation. CALIMA provides a physically motivated framework to interpret dust- and PAH-based observables and to assess dust-mediated feedback in galaxy formation across cosmic time."}

To meet this need, this study extends a robust statistical framework, advancing previous work on heavy-tailed likelihoods, that adapts the hyperbolic likelihood method for full frequency domain applications. The framework is designed to maintain high performance under ideal conditions while improving robustness against non-Gaussian noise and outliers in real-world data. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach through two key case studies. The first case study analyzes a massive black hole binary merger in simulated Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) data with Gaussian noise, showing that the extended hyperbolic likelihood method performs comparably to the more commonly used Whittle likelihood. The second case study examines a stellar-mass black hole binary merger using real ground-based gravitational-wave data containing non-Gaussian noise or overlapping signals, where our framework exhibits increased robustness and yields more accurate parameter estimations. Our results show that the hyperbolic likelihood better captures the true noise distribution, providing a flexible and physically motivated alternative for GW data analysis across current and future detectors."}

We identify several compact (0.05-0.2\") regions having [OI]63um absorption against the far-infrared dust continuum, some of which are possibly reaching below rest-frame CMB radiation level. We also detect narrow, spatially localised [OI]63um emission \"escape channels\" preferentially detected in regions with weak or absent dust continuum emission. We predict that similar absorption effects may appear in the [CII] line, particularly when concentrating on the regions with the densest foreground material along the line of sight. The [OI]63um line appears to be originate from a mix of compact, high optical depth [OI]63um emitting regions and sub-thermally excited, oxygen-rich molecular clouds dispersed throughout high-redshift starbursts that are capable of absorbing the ground-state line emission. Combined with a comparison to cosmological radiation hydrodynamical simulations, this supports the interpretation that regions with higher gas and dust column densities may lead to weakening an intrinsically strong [OI]63um line emission. We argue that the high [OI]63um optical depth is the dominant effect causing the strong absorption, limiting the diagnostic power of this line to trace regions of massive star formation in high-redshift DSFGs."}

This left an open question: Are UDGs something special, or just an extension of the previously known dwarf galaxy population? Seeking to answer this question, in the decade following, dedicated simulations have studied and proposed a myriad of formation pathways to create UDGs. Observations have then pushed the limits of world-class observatories to perform detailed studies of these galaxies in large numbers across the full range of environments in the local Universe. These observations stress test simulations and challenge previous galaxy formation wisdom, with UDGs posing many open puzzles beyond just their unknown formation mechanism. To provide a few pertinent examples: there is observational evidence that not all UDGs follow the standard stellar mass -- halo mass relationship; there is evidence for UDGs with extraordinarily high levels of alpha enhancement; and there is evidence that some UDGs are much more globular cluster rich than other dwarfs of similar stellar mass. In this Dawes review, we undertake the task of summarising the decade of science since the discovery of UDGs. We focus on the quiescent population of UDGs and review their general properties, their proposed formation scenarios, their internal properties and their globular cluster systems. We also provide a brief conjecture on some future directions for the next decade of UDG research."}

Using the Israel junction formalism and a linear barotropic equation of state $p = λ(σ- σ_1)c^2$, we decouple the sound speed $c_s^2 = λc^2$ from the equilibrium equation-of-state parameter $w_0 \\equiv p_0 / (σ_0 c^2)$ and derive the effective potential governing radial dynamics. For observationally motivated parameters, stable configurations with $σ_0>0$ and $0<λ\\leq1$ exist only when $m_+/m_- > 1$. Three distinct stability windows emerge, when $λ=1$: $-3/7 \\lesssim w_0 \\lesssim 1/2$ for $Λ_+ = Λ_-$, $-2/3 \\lesssim w_0 \\lesssim 1/2$ for $Λ_+ > Λ_-$ and $0 \\lesssim w_0 \\lesssim 1$ for $Λ_+ < Λ_-$. Positive-pressure shells ($w_0>0$) reside near the photon sphere, whereas negative-pressure shells ($w_0<0$) extend outward, reaching either the cosmological horizon or the static radius. Stability relies on the variation of $w(σ)$ with the surface energy density. Negative pressure (tension) stabilizes the system because the tension increases during expansion. Conversely, positive pressure stabilizes the system because the pressure increases during contraction. Finally, a static, stable, dark, fluid thin shell acts as a gravitational refractive layer that enlarges the black hole's shadow for a distant, static observer outside the shell. The effect depends on the shell radius $R_0$, the background parameters $(m_{\\pm}, Λ_{\\pm})$, and the equation-of-state. Dark fluid shells can be considered as theoretical toy models that illustrate qualitative effects. Future high-resolution black hole shadow observations could, in principle, use such models to explore how different equations of state might influence observable signatures."}

We examine their star formation rates (SFRs), dust attenuation properties, and the relationship between nebular and stellar reddening. For both samples, SFRs derived from H$α$ are strongly correlated with SFRs from fitting simple star formation histories (SFHs) to the galaxies' spectral energy distributions. In fitting a joint SFR-$\\rm M_*$ relation, we obtain a slope of $\\rm {Δlog(SFR_{Hα})}/{Δlog(M_*/M_\\odot)}=1.01\\pm0.03$, indicating that fair ensembles of SFHs for galaxies at these stellar masses are well-described by scale-free, self-similar forms. We also examine their dust attenuation properties and the relationship between nebular and stellar reddening, exploring how these quantities vary with stellar mass and specific SFR (sSFR). Nebular attenuation increases with stellar mass for IMGs but is lower and less mass-dependent in LMGs, consistent with their reduced dust content. In all cases, stellar continuum attenuation is lower than nebular attenuation, as expected from the two-component dust model. The nebular-to-stellar color excess ratio in both samples is consistent with the canonical factor of 2.27. The ratio is mass-independent, but rises with sSFR in IMGs and remains constant in LMGs. These results suggest that in LMGs, efficient dispersal of birth clouds keeps the differential attenuation approximately constant across sSFR. Thus, although LMGs follow the same global SFR-$\\rm M_*$ scaling as massive galaxies, their lower dust content and feedback-maintained ISM produce distinct attenuation behavior relative to IMGs."}

This construction provides a microphysically specified trace sector, removes the usual matter-Lagrangian ambiguity of $f(R,T)$-type models, and preserves minimal coupling of visible matter by design. We derive the full field equations, the exact dark-sector exchange structure, and the linear scalar-perturbation system in gauge-ready form. In the sub-horizon regime, we derive effective modified-gravity functions governing structure growth and light deflection, and show that the model generically produces correlated, scale- and time-dependent departures from General Relativity in growth and lensing observables. Building on this structure, we formulate a perturbation-focused multi-probe framework based on redshift-space distortions, weak lensing, and CMB lensing, explicitly targeting degeneracy breaking beyond background-expansion tests. The analysis establishes the action-level and perturbation-level foundations of the model and provides a conservative, reproducible framework for translated linear-regime constraints within a dark-sector selective modified-gravity setting."}

However, the current catalogue of overlapping pairs is relatively limited in number compared to catalogues dedicated to individual galaxies. Expanding this catalogue is not only a necessity to facilitate further detailed dust studies beyond the few limited studies conducted thus far, but also to improve pair-to-pair variance and support automated identification through machine learning techniques. To achieve this, we utilise galaxies classified as \"overlapping\" from Galaxy Zoo DECaLS (GZD-1, -2, and -5), along with images from Data Release 10 (DR10) of the DESI Legacy Survey, in our individual citizen science project to classify these pairs directly using volunteers. This new catalogue will not only provide a wealth of targets for future dust studies but will also contribute to a deeper understanding of these pairs and dust as a whole."}

However, only a fraction of the stellar feedback is retained in the cloud and observational constraints are needed to further our understanding of this process. In a sample of 19 nearby galaxies, we match HII regions from PHANGS$\\unicode{x2013}$MUSE to their ionizing stellar source from PHANGS$\\unicode{x2013}$HST and measure the percentage of ionizing radiation that is leaking into the surrounding diffuse ionized gas (DIG). Based on a catalogue, where each HII region is powered by a single young and massive stellar association, we measure a photon escape fraction of $f_\\mathrm{esc}=82^{+12}_{-24}$ per cent. Comparable results are obtained when different procedures are used to match the ionized gas to its source. All samples we study contain a substantial fraction of objects (up to 20 per cent), where the stellar source is not sufficient to produce the H$α$ flux observed from the nebula. Many of them are probably related to uncertain age estimates, but we also find numerous regions, where a significant fraction of the ionizing photon budget is contributed by stars that reside outside the boundaries of the HII region. This motivates the use of an alternative galaxy-wide approach, in which we include all HII regions and stellar sources, not just the ones that show a clear overlap. When summing up the ionization budget over entire galaxies, we measure slightly lower, but consistent values."}

This is the first systematic survey of the [OI]63um fine-structure line at z>4. Using ALMA Bands 9 and 10, we obtain spatially and spectrally resolved observations that probe the interstellar medium on sub-kpc scales. Despite reaching sensitivities 10-100x deeper than most previous studies, we detect [OI]63um in emission in only 2 sources at low significance, with the remaining galaxies yielding stringent non-detections over the full velocity range covered by robust detections of other far-infrared lines, including [CII] and [NII]205um. We identify several compact (0.05-0.2\") regions having [OI]63um absorption against the far-infrared dust continuum, some of which are possibly reaching below rest-frame CMB radiation level. We also detect narrow, spatially localised [OI]63um emission \"escape channels\" preferentially detected in regions with weak or absent dust continuum emission. We predict that similar absorption effects may appear in the [CII] line, particularly when concentrating on the regions with the densest foreground material along the line of sight. The [OI]63um line appears to be originate from a mix of compact, high optical depth [OI]63um emitting regions and sub-thermally excited, oxygen-rich molecular clouds dispersed throughout high-redshift starbursts that are capable of absorbing the ground-state line emission. Combined with a comparison to cosmological radiation hydrodynamical simulations, this supports the interpretation that regions with higher gas and dust column densities may lead to weakening an intrinsically strong [OI]63um line emission. We argue that the high [OI]63um optical depth is the dominant effect causing the strong absorption, limiting the diagnostic power of this line to trace regions of massive star formation in high-redshift DSFGs."}

Different statistical measures constructed from observables probe turbulence properties in different ways. We consider a setup in which synchrotron radiation is emitted in a distant volume and then passes through a turbulent screen that induces Faraday rotation. Using both MHD simulations and synthetic turbulence spectra, we explore the spectrum of observed polarization directions measured at a single frequency as a diagnostic for recovering the statistics of turbulence in both the emitting region and the Faraday-rotation screen. We compare these results with our analytical expectations. We also compare the spectrum of polarization direction (SPD) with the wavelength-derivative diagnostic introduced and analytically explored by Lazarian \\& Pogosyan. We demonstrate that the SPD exhibits greater sensitivity to turbulence in the Faraday screen. We provide an observer-friendly criterion to determine whether the SPD samples turbulence in the synchrotron-emitting region or in the Faraday screen.

Recent numerical simulations have suggested a diversity in the stellar-to-halo mass ratio in this halo mass range, but either the number of samples obtained from the same simulation setup or the numerical resolution was limited. We performed high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations for eight galaxies with a dark matter halo mass of $\\sim 10^9\\rm\\ M_{\\odot}$ up to $t=1.2$ Gyr at which most gas in the galaxies has been expelled. Our samples have a scatter of an order of magnitude in the halo mass at the reionization epoch.

We also observed variation in the compactness of their stellar distributions. Some of our simulated galaxies exhibit a stellar half-mass radius of $\\sim30$ pc, which is as small as that of ultra-compact dwarfs. The formation condition for such a compact stellar distribution is understood as an analog of the condition for the formation of dense, massive star clusters. We found that when the central gas surface density exceeds a critical threshold ($Σ_{\\rm gas} \\gtrsim 30\\rm\\ M_\\odot \\rm\\ {pc}^{-2}$), the star formation becomes highly efficient and results in dense stellar systems.

Using void catalogs from four Millennium Simulation snapshots and SDSS data at $z<0.04$, we perform a unified analysis of void demographics, galaxy properties, and internal kinematics. Our analysis reveals clear evidence that cosmic voids exhibit a significant evolutionary trend of becoming progressively emptier toward low redshift, accompanied by a marked decline in the brightness and clustering of their galaxy populations. The void galaxy luminosity function evolves significantly: $M^{*}$ fades and $α$ flattens with time, with large voids hosting brighter, more rapidly evolving galaxies than small voids. Stacked density profiles exhibit a universal shape when scaled by void radius, deepening and building more pronounced walls toward $z=0$. Galaxy spatial distributions reveal persistent size-dependent segregation, with galaxies in large voids lying farther from the center and more strongly clustered. Dynamical analysis of simulations shows coherent outward flows in all voids, with amplitudes decreasing toward $z=0$, providing a physical basis for observed redshift-space distortions. Comparison with SDSS broadly confirms these evolutionary trends but uncovers a non-zero central galaxy population in observed voids -- absent in $Λ$CDM predictions -- that may challenge current galaxy formation models in extreme underdensities. Future comparisons with additional simulations and deeper high-redshift surveys will provide stronger tests of $Λ$CDM in the most underdense regions."}

Yet direct observational evidence of the dependence of star formation activity on distance to filaments remains scarce and is missing at z>1. We investigate how starburst, main-sequence (MS), and quenched galaxies are distributed with respect to cosmic web filaments, and how this distribution evolves with redshift. We first use the SIMBA cosmological simulation to predict the redshift evolution of the mean distance to the closest filament from z=3 to z=0 for different galaxy populations after removing stellar-mass dependencies. We then measure the corresponding signal in the COSMOS field, using COSMOS2020 and COSMOS-Web data, where accurate photometric redshifts enable reconstruction of the projected cosmic web from z=2 to z=0.5, and starbursts are identified through far-infrared spectral energy distribution fitting. In agreement with the results from SIMBA, starburst galaxies are found closer to filaments at z>1 and at larger distances at z<1, MS galaxies occupy intermediate environments with little evolution, and quenched galaxies show progressively shorter distances to filaments toward low redshift, with a crossing between starburst and MS populations around z~1. In COSMOS-Web, the relative evolution in the average distance to filaments between starburst and MS galaxies is detected at a significance level of at least 5σ. We show that a minimal toy model in which the only environmental ingredient is the sSFR-filament distance modulation measured in simulations is sufficient to reproduce the observed differential evolution of the average filament distance between starburst and MS galaxies. These results show that the imprint of large-scale environmental effects on the star formation activity of galaxies, predicted by simulations, is detectable from z=2 down to z=0.5."}
