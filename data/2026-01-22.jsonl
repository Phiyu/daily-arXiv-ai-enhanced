Here, we show that LRD spectra are naturally reproduced by emission from an accreting Direct Collapse Black Hole (DCBH). Using radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we follow the growth of the DCBH seed via a dense, compressionally heated, collisionally ionized accretion flow. The model self-consistently reproduces the screen responsible for the observed Balmer absorption, while allowing UV/optical emission to partially escape, along with reprocessed infrared radiation. Crucially, this structure is not a blackbody and requires no stellar contribution: the UV continuum originates entirely from reprocessed DCBH radiation, attenuated only by a small amount of dust with an extinction curve consistent with high-redshift galaxies. This single framework simultaneously explains the key observational puzzles of LRDs: (a) weak X-ray emission, (b) metal and high-ionization lines alongside absent star-formation features, (c) overmassive black holes, (d) compact morphology, (e) abundance and redshift evolution -- linking them directly to pristine atomic-cooling halos, (f) long-lived ($>100$ Myr), slowly variable phases driven by radiation pressure. Our findings indicate that JWST is witnessing the widespread formation of heavy black hole seeds in the early Universe."}

Submitted to MNRAS", "summary": "The rapid emergence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe poses a challenge to current models of black hole growth. One promising formation pathway is the direct collapse black hole (DCBH) scenario, in which gas in pristine, low-metallicity halos forms supermassive (or quasi-) stars leading to massive black holes seeds under specific environmental conditions. In this work, we investigate the potential host environments of DCBHs by coupling a semi-analytic model tracing BH formation and galaxy co-evolution with high-resolution N-body dark matter merger trees. This allows us to trace the population of DCBHs formed during the hierarchical assembly of a $\\sim 10^{12} ~\\rm M_\\odot$ dark matter halo hosting a bright $10^9 ~\\rm M_\\odot$ quasar at redshift $z \\approx 7$. We find that, when accounting for local fluctuations in the UV radiation field within this early cosmic structure, massive BH seeds can form via direct collapse as early as $z \\approx 22$. Even under more stringent conditions for heavy seed formation, tens of DCBHs are predicted to emerge within the simulated overdensity down to $z \\sim 14$, at which point metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium inhibits further episodes of direct collapse. A significant fraction of the massive black hole population formed at $z > 14$ is expected to survive in satellite galaxies that do not merge with the central halo down to $z \\approx 7$. We show that the existence of such a population of ungrown heavy BH seeds can be probed through deep JWST observations targeting regions surrounding bright high-redshift quasars, and we discuss tailored observational strategies to detect and identify these elusive systems."}

We introduce a method that relies exclusively on tracking individual maser components, rather than assuming a single averaged trajectory as in previous works, thereby avoiding arbitrary data averaging that can bias interpretations of the disk's geometry and dynamics. This approach requires spatially resolved individual maser components; consequently, the majority of observational epochs were excluded, as they lack sufficient spatial resolution to localize the maser position. We track individual maser components across multiple epochs and introduce an efficient marginalization method over nuisance parameters (angular radius and azimuth of each maser), reducing the number of free parameters from hundreds to 14. Our analysis reveals that the current observational cadence is insufficient to reliably track the individual masers, which our method relies on, given their intrinsic variability. Across a range of maser selections and model configurations, inferred distances span approximately between 6.7 to 8.1 Mpc, demonstrating significant sensitivity to how our method selects individual masers. Even visually and statistically robust fits can differ by several standard deviations, reflecting ambiguity in component identification across sparsely sampled epochs. We evaluate the impact of observational cadence on tracking fidelity and distance precision, and show that high-cadence monitoring is needed for our method to track individual masers and produce a robust anchor for cosmology."}

When pairs of mirror images of such star clusters appear across the lensing critical curve, it is usually assumed that both images will display identical spectral energy distributions (SEDs). However, this assumption may be invalidated in the presence of gravitational microlensing from stars or other compact objects in the lens, since microlensing will affect the SED contribution from bright stars within the star cluster independently in the two mirror images. Here, we explore under what circumstances mismatched mirror-image SEDs are likely to be observable, and argue that SED differences detectable in JWST observations of lensing-cluster fields will be limited to star clusters of mass $< 10^5\\ M_\\odot$ and ages $\\lesssim 5$ Myr.

Submitted to A&A", "summary": "Extended warm and cold gas nebulae, with complex morphologies and kinematics, have been observed in the centres of cool-core galaxy clusters. Their origin within the hot intracluster medium (ICM) is still puzzling, and among many mechanisms, positive feedback from the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) has been proposed. In this work, we performed a suite of very high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of a Perseus-like cool-core galaxy cluster subject to self-regulated AGN jet feedback, which leads to realistic ICM properties. By explicitly following warm ionized, neutral, and molecular gas phases, we studied the complex interplay between AGN activity and the multi-phase ICM. While AGN feedback globally heats the ICM, we find that during the individual AGN jet bursts, hot material is also injected laterally to the jet axis, within the turbulent mixing layer. This material, as it expands, compresses the surrounding hot ICM, reducing the local cooling time, and leads to the formation of cold clumps on a characteristic timescale of $\\sim 30$ Myr. By employing tracers, we explicitly track cooling within the affected regions, finding that very hot gas identified in high-compression, low-vorticity zones condenses in situ to form cold clumps. A statistical analysis reveals that the condensation of cold gas is highly promoted once the local turbulent Mach number, $σ_{hot}/c_{s,hot}$, in the hot gas component ($T \\geq 10^7$ K) takes values around ~0.3. The presented process is a further important step in understanding the physical mechanisms that lead to the formation of cold gas in the cluster core. Our measured values of the characteristic turbulent Mach number, together with detailed multi-phase gas kinematics predictions, provide important theoretical tools to interpret future X-ray spectroscopy and deep radio data, ultimately to constrain the origin of cool-core cluster nebulae."}

As these photons travel through the intergalactic medium, their scattering cross-section is often approximated as a delta function at resonance due to computational cost. That is, photons with emitted wavelengths between Ly$α$ and Ly$β$ are assumed to travel in straight lines until they redshift into the Ly$α$ resonance. However, due to the damping wing in the Ly$α$ cross-section, this approximation fails as the frequency of the photon approaches the resonant frequency, resulting in multiple scatterings events that could be separated by non-negligible distances. Some previous works studied this effect of Ly$α$ multiple scattering by running computationally heavy radiative-transfer simulations. However, robustly interpreting the cosmic 21cm signal requires exploring a large parameter space of astrophysical uncertainties, motivating more computationally-efficient approaches. Here we incorporate Ly$α$ multiple scatterings in the public, semi-numerical simulation 21cmFAST. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to study the trajectories of Ly$α$ photons on different scales. We find that the distance distributions of Ly$α$ photons with respect to the absorption point can be modeled as analytical functions that are governed by a single parameter. Upon implementing the distance distributions in 21cmFAST, we find that the multiple scattering effect is important (about 50% difference in the 21-cm power spectrum) only at high redshifts before the spin temperature is fully coupled to the kinetic temperature. Furthermore, we find that Ly$α$ multiple scattering does not enhance Ly$α$ heating, and that the combined effect is negligible, especially under realistic X-ray heating scenarios."}

By employing a time-domain mode-sum method, we analyze the complex interplay between an incident burst signal and the black hole spacetime. We find that the incident waves can non-resonantly excite a substantial number of high-$l$ modes, with amplitudes for modes as high as l=20 remaining significant compared to the fundamental l=0 mode. We confirm through QNM template fitting that the late-time behaviors of these excited modes are indeed QNMs. After passing through the black hole, we find that the lensed waves form a highly directional and coherent Gaussian beam whose cross-sectional intensity profile is well-described by a Gaussian profile. Unlike spherical waves, this beam's amplitude does not decrease with distance from the black hole but remains nearly constant in the near-field region. Moreover, due to the superposition of numerous QNMs, oscillations largely cancel each other out. The lensed temporal waves do not exhibit typical oscillatory patterns."}

In this review, we provide a comprehensive description of the statistical tools developed to characterize voids, the theoretical models that link them to cosmological parameters, and the methodologies used to extract information from survey data. We highlight the growing synergy between void-based observables and other cosmological probes, and showcase the increasingly stringent constraints derived from voids measured from current survey data and expected from future missions. With the advent of the next generation of galaxy surveys, voids are poised to play a central role in the future of cosmology, turning what was once regarded as emptiness into one of the most promising frontiers of fundamental science."}

Starting from the higher-order extended uncertainty principle (HOEUP), we obtain the modified entropy-area relation. Then, we derive the modified Friedmann equations through three different approaches: the first law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon, the entropic gravity case, and the emergence of cosmic space. Furthermore, we check the validity of the generalised second law (GSL). Notably, HOEUP modified Friedmann equations are the limiting cases of those obtained from a recently proposed novel entropy, which is derived from Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) [{\\it Phys. Dark Universe} {\\bf 49} (2025) 101967]. Motivated by this connection, we derive a novel EUP, referred to as MOND EUP, from a reverse procedure. This novel EUP reproduces to EUP relations associated with Rényi and dual Kaniadakis entropies in the limiting cases. Moreover, we show that HOEUP corresponds to perturbative limit of MOND entropy. The main new result of this paper is a reverse procedure beginning from a recently proposed novel MOND entropy to construct a unified EUP. This reverse procedure is not limited with the present case. In principle, the method can be applied to other generalised entropy formalisms, suggesting that our findings may establish a unified framework that bridges the generalised entropies, cutoff mechanisms, and EUP models. In particular, the corresponding modified uncertainty principles may have effective cutoff mechanisms for the entropy forms, which do not explicitly display cutoff mechanisms. Thus, these entropies may have cutoff mechanism due to their corresponding modified uncertainty principles."}

However, our galaxy also contains a non-axisymmetric stellar bar, which traps stars in resonant orbits, leading to substructures in phase-space. Using a high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamic cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way analogue, we explore the connection between the bar and the accreted stellar halo. We find that the bar induces prominent substructures, or \"ridges\", in E-Lz, caused by the resonances. The most pronounced of these is caused by the corotation and the retrograde 1:1 resonances, with weaker ridges visible due to the prograde 1:1 and outer Lindblad resonance. The ridges are present across much of the stellar halo, with variations in radius due to the morphology of different orbital families. We explore the scattering of orbits at the resonances, finding that stars trapped at the 1:1 retrograde resonance become more circularised and have more negative angular momentum. Additionally, stars can move between the corotation and retrograde 1:1 families, thus alternating between prograde and retrograde motion. Due to these scatterings and the pre-existing metallicity gradients in the accreted population, the bar-induced substructures have distinct metallicities compared to stars in the surrounding phase-space. Our results suggest the need for caution when searching the Milky Way stellar halo for accreted substructures in both integral of motions and chemical spaces, since these can be induced by internal perturbations."}

Cosmological as well as idealised simulations reveal that the dark matter (DM) haloes interact with baryonic matter, primarily the stellar bars, dynamically by means of the exchange of angular momentum. In these simulations, the spherical DM halo dynamically responds to interaction with the stellar bar by reshaping its orbital structure in the proximity of the stellar bar, forming a bar-like configuration, called as the Dark Matter (DM) bar. Using N-body simulations of Milky Way analogs we discuss the role of inner halo angular momentum, measured as halo spin parameter λ of the dark matter halo, on formation and evolutionary characteristics of the DM bars. Our systematic study involves haloes with initial spin configurations ranging from λ = 0 to 0.1. The result conveys that DM bar formation and its characteristics are extensively dependent on the initial spin parameter λ of the DM halo. We demonstrate that the strength of the dark matter bar gradually increases with an increase in halo spin in long-term evolution, with a significant impact of stellar bar buckling on dark matter bar strength. The evolutionary characteristics of the DM bar are strongly influenced by the initial spin of the host halo."}

In the residual X-ray surface brightness maps, where the global ICM distribution has been subtracted, cold fronts generated by gas sloshing are observed at the boundaries of the spiral excesses. We perform a systematic and comprehensive study of the surface brightness edges along the spiral excesses. We find the deficit of the thermal pressure radially inward of the brightness edges, in contrast to stripping cold fronts that typically exhibit higher thermal pressure in brightness edges. Assuming that the sharp edges in the X-ray surface brightness distributions are sustained entirely by the gas bulk motions, we estimate the velocity gradients across the edges that are required to compensate for the deficit of the thermal pressure. We do not find statistically significant velocity gradients along the azimuthal direction.

Clusters that are dynamically relaxed are especially useful targets of study because of their morphological and dynamical simplicity. However, at redshifts z > 1, very few such clusters have been identified. We present results from new Chandra observations of the cluster SPT-CL J2215-3537 (hereafter SPT J2215), at z = 1.16, the second most distant relaxed, cool-core cluster identified to date. We place constraints on the cluster's total mass profile and investigate its thermodynamic profiles, scaling relations (gas mass, average temperature, and X-ray luminosity), and metal enrichment, resolving the cool core and providing essential context for the massive starburst seen in its central galaxy. We contextualize the thermodynamic and cosmological properties of the cluster within a sample of well-studied, lower-redshift relaxed systems. In this way, SPT J2215 serves as a powerful high-redshift benchmark for understanding the formation of cool cores and the evolution of massive clusters of galaxies."}

Focusing on free--fall dynamics in the Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes in the test--particle limit, we employ an effective--potential heuristic approach to isolate the roles of the specific energy $E$, specific angular momentum $L$, and black--hole spin $a$. Within this framework, we identify well--defined regions of parameter space in which the Kerr spacetime leads to stronger or weaker local radial infall than the Schwarzschild case at the same radius. By analysing the kinematics of infalling geodesic congruences, we show how these local regimes combine along complete trajectories to either enhance or reduce gravitational focusing. We then interpret these results within a covariant 1+3 description of general relativity, in terms of the expansion, shear and Raychaudhuri evolution of timelike congruences. We demonstrate that black--hole rotation systematically modifies the shear of infalling irrotational flows, even when the magnitude of the local expansion is reduced, and that this shear modulation governs the overall rate of focusing. Our work complements previous studies of relativistic infall by providing a unified energetic and geometric interpretation of how angular momentum and rotation can strengthen or weaken gravitational collapse relative to the non--rotating case."}

In the age of large Integral Field Unit (IFU) surveys, studies of the AGN-SF connection greatly benefit from spatially resolving AGN and SF contributions to study the two processes independently. Using IFU data for 54 local active galaxies from the S7 sample, we present a new method to separate emission from AGN activity and SF using mixing sequences observed in the [NII]$λ6584$/H$α$ vs. [OIII]$λ5007$/H$β$ Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram. We use the new decomposition method to calculate the H$α$ star-formation rate and AGN [OIII] luminosity for the galaxies. Our new method is robust to outliers in the line-ratio distribution and can be applied to large galaxy samples with little manual intervention. We infer star-formation histories (SFHs) using pPXF, conducting detailed recovery tests to determine the quantities that can be considered robust. We test the correlation between the AGN Eddington ratio, using the proxy L[OIII]/$σ_*^4$, and star-formation properties. We find a moderately strong correlation between the Eddington ratio and the star-formation rate (SFR). We also observe marginally significant correlations between the AGN Eddington ratio and the light-weighted stellar age under 100 Myr. Our results point to higher AGN accretion being associated with young nuclear star formation under 100 Myr, consistent with timelines presented in previous studies. The correlations found in this paper are relatively weak; extending our methods to larger samples, including radio-quiet galaxies, will help better constrain the physical mechanisms and timescales of the AGN-SF connection."}

The largest and least biased statistical samples of galaxies for use in clustering analyses can be collected photometrically through large imaging surveys. However, selecting clean photometric subsamples for cosmology are crucial for avoiding contamination that can bias cosmological constraints. Here we present the MagLim++ galaxy sample, selected to optimize for cosmological constraining power and incorporating an array of novel quality cuts to identify and remove residual contamination. This sample comes from the full six years of observations from the Dark Energy Survey. We present measurements of the two-point angular clustering ($w(θ)$) of 9,186,205 galaxies distributed over 4031 sq. degrees and in six tomographic redshift bins centered at $\\bar{z}\\approx$ [0.31, 0.44, 0.62, 0.78, 0.90, 1.01].

By extending the traditional Walker-Penrose method, which is limited by its reliance on specific symmetric structures and Killing tensors, we overcome these limitations by constructing an ordinary differential equations (ODEs) numerical framework that combines the photon orbit equation with the polarization parallel transport equation. This allows for the self-consistent evolution of photon trajectories and polarization states in any spacetime backgrounds without relying on specific symmetries. Using this framework, we analyze the effects of black hole spin and charge on the polarization characteristics of radiation from both prograde and retrograde accretion disks. Our results show that black hole charge can significantly modify photon trajectories and polarization patterns: increasing charge compresses and distorts the EVPA structure on photon-ring scales, inducing localized rotations and asymmetries that may provide a potential diagnostic of a nonzero black hole charge."}

We focus on two well-known stellar overdensities in the anticenter, the Monoceros Ring (MRi) and Anticenter Stream (ACS). We find that the MRi overdensity has kinematics consistent with a tidally induced spiral arm, a type of dynamic spiral arm created by an interaction with a satellite galaxy, most likely the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal galaxy (Sgr). We use the kinematics of the MRi to calculate the two most recent passage times of Sgr are 0.25 $\\pm$ 0.09 Gyrs and 1.10 $\\pm$ 0.23 Gyrs from the present day. We validate that the ACS is kinematically decoupled from the MRi because they are moving in opposite radial and vertical directions. We find that the kinematics associated with the ACS are not confined to our defined overdensity. The features we see in the ACS region are likely part of a broader distribution of stars with the same kinematic signature as detected in other places, like the vertical wave in the outer disk and phase spiral."}

By integrating infrared band coverage from Roman HLWAS with LSST's optical bands, IRMaGiC enables red-sequence calibration at higher redshifts. We demonstrate that IRMaGiC reduces scatter and bias in photometric redshift estimates for LRGs at higher redshift, providing more accurate redshift assessments compared to existing methods.

Our framework provides a local picture of the structural evolution of a relativistic restricted three-body problem around a deformed black hole in an adiabatically evolving binary, motivated by various astrophysical settings including disk dynamics and extreme mass-ratio inspirals. As the tidal-field strength is increased, initially regular, bound geodesics undergo four stages: (i) weak chaos emerges within the bound motion; (ii) a subset of trajectories plunges into the black hole; (iii) a fraction of the remaining trajectories becomes unbound; and (iv) no bound trajectories persist. We provide semi-analytic estimates for the critical tidal amplitudes associated with each transition. Our estimates indicate that, within the frequency band of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, the matter flow around black holes may already be depleted, whereas LISA and (B-)DECIGO could probe the earlier stages. Our results suggest that an object orbiting a tidally deformed massive BH may remain near resonances over a wide range of separations, indicating an accumulated, non-negligible impact on the gravitational-wave phase. Tidal perturbations can also introduce nonlinear couplings among epicyclic oscillations of geodesics, offering a potential avenue to resonant excitation of quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray light curves from accreting black holes."}

To enable a comparison with PCA-based studies, which have been widely used in multi-line analyses, we apply our framework to integrated intensity maps of 13 molecular lines from Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 3 archival data of the nearby galaxy NGC 1068. Previous PCA-based studies of NGC 1068 reported that physically meaningful structures are mainly captured up to the second component. In contrast, our framework can interpret physically meaningful features up to the fourth component. Furthermore, by comparing the results obtained from our framework with molecular column densities derived from local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE) analysis, we suggest that the abundance of HCO+ is relatively enhanced in the molecular outflow region extending to a radius of about 400 pc from the galactic center, likely due to the effects of ultraviolet radiation and highly dense gas. These results show that our framework can provide data-driven insights into physical and chemical features that have not been clearly identified in previous studies.

Two primary mechanisms drive this process: star-formation (SF) & mergers. Our understanding of star formation, and to some degree the processes that influence the baryon cycle (environment, gas supply, feedback, etc), are either relatively well constrained or will develop significantly over the coming decades via upcoming facilities (i.e. through their imprint on galaxy properties measured with deep multi-wavelength and spectroscopic data). However, the same can not be said for mergers. It is telling that we indirectly know hierarchical assembly through mergers is one of the most crucial processes that shape our Universe, but the robust observational measurement of mergers is almost non-existent outside of the local Universe - let alone how these mergers impact galaxy properties. This is not likely to significantly change in the coming decades as existing or approved facilities/surveys are inadequate in charactering mergers in the distant Universe. Motivated by this, we discuss an ambitious study to first explore mergers, and then the co-dependent astrophysical process that govern the accumulation of stellar mass over the last ~10billion years, and highlight the essential need for a 10m+ class multi-object spectroscopic facility."}

After filtering for AGN (via X-ray detections, hot mid-infrared dust and extended radio emission), as well as blended sources, we obtained a sample of SFGs comprising: 11 cataloged radio detections, 18 non-cataloged detections (at ~3-5sigma) and 298 undetected sources. Stacking the 298 undetected sources we obtain a 3.3sigma detection in the radio. This sample, along with a local sample of Paschen-alpha emitters, lies along previous radio luminosity/SFR relations from local (z<0.2) to high redshift (z~1). Fitting the FRESCO data at 1.0<=z<=1.8 we find log(L_1.4GHz) = (1.31+/-0.17) x log(SFR_Pa-alpha) + (21.36+/-0.17) which is consistent with other literature relations. We can explain some of the observed scatter in the L_1.4GHz/SFR_Pa-alpha correlation by a toy model in which the synchrotron emission is a delayed/averaged tracer of the instantaneous Paschen-alpha SFR by ~10/75 Myr."}

Straightfoward exact solutions exist when the evolution is described by a linear differential equation, corresponding to constant, linear, and quadratic potentials. In the nonlinear case, exact solutions are derived for $V = V_0\\ln φ$, $V = V_0 φ^{1/2}$ and $V = V_0/φ$, and the logarithmic potential also yields an exact first integral. These complicated parametric solutions are considerably less useful than those derived previously for a universe dominated by a barotropic fluid such as matter or radiation with $w_B > -1$. However, we generalize the slow-roll approximation and show that it applies to all sufficiently flat potentials in the case of a vacuum-dominated expansion, while it never applies when the universe is dominated by a background fluid with $w_B > -1$."}

One possible mechanism for triggering these starbursts is mergers and interactions, but detecting these at high redshift remains a challenge. Observations of high-redshift gravitationally lensed galaxies enable studies of the interstellar medium and environment of these extreme starbursts in detail. We used high angular resolution observations of dust continuum, CO(6-5), H2O(211-202), and H2O+(202-111) emission to constrain the ongoing processes in the z = 3.63 gravitationally lensed submillimeter galaxy H-ATLAS J083051.0+013224 (G09v1.97). We used PyAutoLens to create a de-magnified source plane CO(6-5) emission line cube and performed kinematic modeling using 3DBarolo. Additionally, we investigated the properties of the continuum and molecular line emission in the source plane. We find that the regions of CO(6-5) and H2O(211-202) emission match closely in the source plane but that the dust continuum emission is more compact. We find that our lens modeling results do not require more than one source, contrary to what has been found in previous studies. Instead, we find that G09v1.97 resembles a rotating disk with Vmax/sigma = 2.8 +/- 0.4 with evidence for residual emission indicative of non-circular motions such as outflows, tidal tails, or an additional background galaxy. We suggest that the origin of the non-circular motions may be associated with a bi-conical outflow, a tidal tail from an interaction, or indicate the possible presence of an additional galaxy. We calculate the dynamical mass, gas mass, star-formation rate, and depletion time for G09v1.97 and find a high star-formation rate and low gas depletion time. In combination, this suggests that G09v1.97 has recently undergone an interaction, triggering intense star formation, and is in the process of settling into a disk."}

Since normal type 1 and type 2 AGNs are known to show different polarization properties, detailed investigations of the CLAGN polarization can shed light on the underlying mechanisms responsible for the changing-look phenomenon. We present new (spectro)polarimetric observations of two changing-look AGNs located in the core of the inclined spiral galaxies NGC 1365 and NGC 2992. Both AGNs are radio emitters, thereby enabling a comparison of their polarization to the radio jet axis, which defines the accretion disk geometry. In the case of NGC 1365, the AGN shows polarization characteristics consistent with those observed in type 1 Seyferts, in particular polarization parallel to the radio jet. This intrinsic polarization is modified by the wavelength-dependent dichroic extinction that occurs in the galaxy bar and that rotates the polarization angle at the shortest wavelengths. NGC 2992, on the other hand, is so inclined that dichroic dust extinction in the disk completely dominates the polarization of the AGN, thus overwhelming any polarization due to scattering. Consequently, the polarization properties remain essentially constant between the different AGN states, and the faint broad lines observed in the polarized flux are most likely not scattered light. Differential dilution between the continuum and the narrow-line polarizations can explain the unusually high polarization measured in the emission lines."}

Recent optical continuum reverberation mapping studies have suggested potential lag variations between different epochs, offering important clues to the physical mechanisms governing variability in the vicinity of the central black hole. We present continuous intranight multi-band photometric monitoring of NGC 4395 based on three nights of observations with the Faulkes Telescope North and two nights with the Mephisto telescope. This represents the first systematic investigation of optical continuum lag stability in a robustly confirmed IMBH. By applying difference-imaging techniques to both the new observations and archival data, we significantly detect the optical inter-band lags of $\\sim$5-15 minutes, which increase monotonically with wavelength. No obvious $u$-band lag excess is observed, implying a negligible fractional contribution from diffuse continuum (DC) emission to the optical continuum, in agreement with our spectral decomposition results. Remarkably, the inter-band lags remain stable over multi-year baselines. We attribute this long-term lag stability primarily to the minor DC contribution, a relatively steady disk-corona structure, and the unusually high X-ray-to-optical luminosity ratio characteristic of low-luminosity AGNs, which likely allows X-ray reprocessing to dominate over other potential variability mechanisms. Future facilities like Gemini/SCORPIO, with its simultaneous optical-to-near-infrared coverage, will be ideally suited to play an important role in advancing this field."}

We investigate its effects on the Dark Energy Survey Year 6 galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing analyses using the fiducial lens (position tracer) sample MagLim++. Magnification bias is parameterized by a coefficient that describes the response of the number of selected objects per unlensed area element to a change in the lensing convergence. We quantify this coefficient using the Balrog synthetic source injection catalog to account for the complexity of the selection function, and compare these results with simplified estimates. The resulting values of the magnification coefficients for each redshift bin are [3.16 $\\pm$ 0.08, 2.76 $\\pm$ 0.21, 4.09 $\\pm$ 0.15, 4.42 $\\pm$ 0.16, 4.90 $\\pm$ 0.29, 4.83 $\\pm$ 0.25]. Relative to Year 3, this analysis provides more precise and accurate magnification bias estimates through a larger Balrog area and reweighting to better match the data properties. The cosmological results are robust when tested against various magnification parameter prior choices and also when adding cross-clustering between lens redshift bins. Neglecting magnification, however, introduces significant systematic shifts: relative to the fiducial analysis with Gaussian priors centered on the Balrog-derived estimates, we observe shifts of 1.37$σ$ in $S_8$ and -0.84$σ$ in $Ω_m$ (with cosmic shear included: -0.61$σ$ in $S_8$ and -0.71$σ$ in $Ω_m$), in agreement with findings from simulated data, demonstrating that magnification must be modeled to avoid biases. Freeing the magnification bias in lens bin 2 leads to unphysical negative values, further justifying its exclusion from the fiducial Year 6 analysis."}

Reconciling these models with local tests often requires strong screening, leading to environment-dependent clustering. We investigate such effects via a late-time structure-induced phase transition driven by a non-minimally coupled scalar field. For this purpose, we introduce norns, a fully relativistic cosmological particle-mesh code that self-consistently evolves a complex scalar field - a generalisation of the symmetron producing global U(1) strings rather than domain walls. Using simulations, we compare string and wall-forming models, quantifying impacts on the matter power spectrum, halo mass function, and defect dynamics. Strong environment-dependent effects can generate significant departures from LCDM in underdense regions while keeping the overall power spectrum changes modest (~ 4-15% at k~0.3-0.5 h Mpc^-1, sub-percent for z > 0.2). We find that an attractive fifth force can locally suppress structure growth in voids while enhancing it in surrounding overdense regions by driving outflows from the voids. These effects leave distinctive signatures in the matter density probability density function and in marked halo power spectra, which are likely detectable in low-redshift data."}

This together with the large spatial scale of~ 6.4 kpc suggest a large scale generating mechanism (such as tidal interaction or merger) that lasted for ~500 Myr. On the other hand, the outflowing wind is much younger and is probably the result of the intense star formation. Therefore, could it be that the star formation drives also turbulence on small scales? In the present work we utilize multi-point second order structure functions to find whether there exists also a small scale turbulence in this galaxy, and if so, try to identify its drivers. We obtained evidence for small scale turbulence whose largest spatial scale ~240 pc for the nebular gas velocity field and ~ 290 pc$ for the outflowing wind velocity field.

In this work, we develop a new analysis pipeline PyGxGW-PTA for studying the cross-correlation of nHz GW signal with galaxy surveys ($C^{\\rm g\\, GW}_\\ell$) and obtain the first constraint on the SGWB and galaxy distribution cross-correlation using the NANOGrav 15-year dataset in combination with the DESI galaxy catalog. We find no statistically significant correlation between the SGWB and the large-scale distribution of DESI galaxies and using an optimal estimator we put an upper bound on $C^{\\rm g\\, GW}_{\\ell=8} < 0.0083$ at $95\\%$ C.I. This yields the first observational upper limit on the spatial correlation between the nHz SGWB and the large-scale structure of the Universe, establishing the observational groundwork for future multi-tracer analyses that will combine PTA data with next-generation galaxy surveys to unveil the SMBHB-galaxy correlation."}

A powerful way of addressing this question is using radio-continuum observations, where the radio waves are unaffected by dust and are able to reach sufficient resolution to resolve individual galaxies. We present an investigation of the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity functions (RLFs) of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) using deep radio continuum observations in the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields, covering a combined area of $\\sim 4\\,\\mathrm{deg}^2$. These data enable the most accurate measurement of the evolution in the SFRD from mid-frequency radio continuum observations. We model the total RLF as the sum of evolving SFG and AGN components, negating the need for individual source classification. We find that the SFGs have systematically higher space densities at fixed luminosity than found in previous radio studies, but consistent with more recent studies with MeerKAT. We attribute this to the excellent low-surface brightness sensitivity of MeerKAT.\n  We then determine the evolution of the SFRD. Adopting the far-infrared - radio correlation results in a significantly higher the SFRD at $z > 1$, compared to combined UV and far-infrared measurements. However, using more recent relations for the correlation between star-formation rate and radio luminosity, based on full spectral energy distribution modelling, can resolve this apparent discrepancy. Thus radio observations provide a powerful method of determining the total SFRD, in the absence of dust-sensitive far-infrared data."}

We interpret the impact of this measurement in the context of the statistical preference for $w_0w_a$CDM over $Λ$CDM when combined with DES Y5 Type Ia supernovae (SN), Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and DESI BAO. Based on our previous work, using the full Y6 DES BAO sample, in combination with SN, CMB and DESI DR1 BAO, added 0.3$σ$ in this preference (from 3.7$σ$ to 4.0$σ$), but this ignored possible correlations between datasets. Using our new DESI-independent DES BAO likelihood instead, we find a smaller increase in the statistical preference for $w_0w_a$CDM, from 3.7$σ$ to 3.8$σ$ when using DESI DR1 BAO, and from 4.0$σ$ to 4.1$σ$ when updating to the more recent DESI DR2 BAO.

Massive stars impact their surrounding initiating star-formation along their photo-dissociation region. Once the HII region is formed it is unclear if and how the second generation of stars impacts its aspect and evolution. Methods. We performed high spectral resolution (R ~ 23400) Ha Fabry-Perot observations in five fields covering the Galactic HII region NGC 7538 and lead profiles multi-gaussian fitting to extract the parameters as peak intensity, width and velocity. We then analyse the kinematics of the ionised gas building kinematic diagrams and second order structure functions for every field. Results. The observations reveal a general blue-shifted ionised gas flow larger than 11 km s-1 in NGC 7538, consistent with previous studies. Profiles originating from features that are dark in Ha due to extinction or from outside the region show velocity dispersion larger than the one typically found for the Warm Interstellar Medium. The analysis of kinematic diagrams and second-order structure functions reveals non-thermal motions attributed to turbulence and large-scale velocity gradients. In the direction of the HII region itself the turbulence seems to be shock-dominated, with a characteristic scale length between ~ 0.72 and 1.46 pc. In this context, we propose that the kinematics of the central part of the region could be explained by the superposition of the outflow coming from IRS1 and a wind bow shock formed ahead IRS6."}

Reconciling these models with local tests often requires strong screening, leading to environment-dependent clustering. We investigate such effects via a late-time structure-induced phase transition driven by a non-minimally coupled scalar field. For this purpose, we introduce norns, a fully relativistic cosmological particle-mesh code that self-consistently evolves a complex scalar field - a generalisation of the symmetron producing global U(1) strings rather than domain walls. Using simulations, we compare string and wall-forming models, quantifying impacts on the matter power spectrum, halo mass function, and defect dynamics. Strong environment-dependent effects can generate significant departures from LCDM in underdense regions while keeping the overall power spectrum changes modest (~ 4-15% at k~0.3-0.5 h Mpc^-1, sub-percent for z > 0.2). We find that an attractive fifth force can locally suppress structure growth in voids while enhancing it in surrounding overdense regions by driving outflows from the voids. These effects leave distinctive signatures in the matter density probability density function and in marked halo power spectra, which are likely detectable in low-redshift data."}

However, key parameters governing interstellar surface chemistry, such as diffusion energy barriers, remain poorly constrained. In particular, surface diffusion constitutes a fundamental step for the synthesis of complex organic molecules and plays a crucial role in understanding the desorption process. In this paper, the diffusion dynamics of carbon monoxide (CO) on amorphous solid water (ASW) surfaces, representative of interstellar ices, is modeled with quantum-chemical methods. Employing a representative ensemble of water clusters, each made by 22 molecules, diffusion energy barriers between the binding sites are computed using Density Functional Theory. Diffusion rate coefficients are then determined by applying the harmonic approximation of Transition State Theory. The results, in agreement with experimental studies, revealed a wide distribution of diffusion energies. This reflects the intrinsic topological heterogeneity of ASW surfaces, and highlights how surface mobility significantly influences CO's desorption dynamics and, as a consequence, surface-mediated reactivity in interstellar environments. We show that key parameters commonly employed in astrochemical models, like the ratio between binding and diffusion energy, should be carefully revised."}

Here, we show that LRD spectra are naturally reproduced by emission from an accreting Direct Collapse Black Hole (DCBH). Using radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we follow the growth of the DCBH seed via a dense, compressionally heated, collisionally ionized accretion flow. The model self-consistently reproduces the screen responsible for the observed Balmer absorption, while allowing UV/optical emission to partially escape, along with reprocessed infrared radiation. Crucially, this structure is not a blackbody and requires no stellar contribution: the UV continuum originates entirely from reprocessed DCBH radiation, attenuated only by a small amount of dust with an extinction curve consistent with high-redshift galaxies. This single framework simultaneously explains the key observational puzzles of LRDs: (a) weak X-ray emission, (b) metal and high-ionization lines alongside absent star-formation features, (c) overmassive black holes, (d) compact morphology, (e) abundance and redshift evolution -- linking them directly to pristine atomic-cooling halos, (f) long-lived ($>100$ Myr), slowly variable phases driven by radiation pressure.

Millimeter-wave continuum emission offers a potential window into this obscured phase, as it can trace Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) activity through mechanisms less affected by dust extinction. In this work, we test whether the observed correlation between millimeter ($\\sim200,\\mathrm{GHz}$) and hard X-ray (14 - 150,keV) luminosities can be used to plausibly identify hidden AGN in local (Ultra)Luminous Infrared Galaxies (U)LIRGs, including systems hosting confirmed dual AGN. We identify three sources -- one confirmed AGN and two strong candidates -- presenting significant evidence of AGN activity. The confirmed dual AGN lie within $\\sim3σ$ of the mm--X-ray correlation, suggesting this relation can be used to identify hidden pairs. By combining the position of each source relative to this correlation with independent star formation rate constraints, we propose a method to disentangle AGN and star formation contributions for sources with measured column densities. While our analysis is based on a small, heterogeneous local sample and relies on empirical scaling relations, these results indicate that millimeter continuum emission may provide a useful complementary diagnostic for obscured SMBH growth. ALMA observations at high angular resolutions are particularly valuable for this approach, while future facilities such as the ngVLA will be essential to test its robustness in larger and more distant samples."}

The sample is composed of galaxies from the ROGUE I/II catalogue belonging to the SDSS MGS and is divided into optically inactive radio galaxies (OPIRGs), optically active ones (OPARGs) and radio Seyferts. We use optical, mid-infrared and radio data to calculate the AGN bolometric luminosities, accretion rate ($λ$), black-hole mass ($M_{BH}$) and $\\mathcal{R}$. Results. Contrary to some previous studies based on restricted samples, using our complete sample of objects with redshifts $z < 0.4$, we find no evidence of bimodality in $\\mathcal{R}$. The highest $\\mathcal{R}$ values are associated with extended radio structures. $\\mathcal{R}$ is anti-correlated with $λ$, and spans about 2 dex at fixed $λ$.

We demonstrate that the improved agreement is largely due to super-Eddington growth of supermassive black holes (BHs) at high redshift. We run a series of $(100~\\mathrm{cMpc})^{3}$ simulations with the COLIBRE subgrid physics, varying the maximum allowed BH accretion rate in units of the Eddington rate. We show that only the fiducial COLIBRE model, which permits super-Eddington accretion, is consistent with the JWST constraints at $z \\gtrsim 6$. Moreover, we find that in COLIBRE about $50$ per cent of BH mass growth at high redshift occurs in the super-Eddington regime, even though such events are extremely rare in time.

Within this framework, we identify well--defined regions of parameter space in which the Kerr spacetime leads to stronger or weaker local radial infall than the Schwarzschild case at the same radius. By analysing the kinematics of infalling geodesic congruences, we show how these local regimes combine along complete trajectories to either enhance or reduce gravitational focusing. We then interpret these results within a covariant 1+3 description of general relativity, in terms of the expansion, shear and Raychaudhuri evolution of timelike congruences. We demonstrate that black--hole rotation systematically modifies the shear of infalling irrotational flows, even when the magnitude of the local expansion is reduced, and that this shear modulation governs the overall rate of focusing. Our work complements previous studies of relativistic infall by providing a unified energetic and geometric interpretation of how angular momentum and rotation can strengthen or weaken gravitational collapse relative to the non--rotating case."}

II. Implications for the evolutionary paths between star-forming and passive galaxies", "comment": "Accepted by A&A", "summary": "The baryonic mass-size relation of galaxies links the total baryonic mass (stars plus gas) to the baryonic half-mass radius. In the first paper of this series, we showed that star-forming galaxies from the SPARC sample follow two distinct relations in the baryonic mass-size plane: one defined by high-surface-density (HSD), star-dominated, Sa-to-Sc galaxies, and one defined by low-surface-density (LSD), gas-dominated, Sd-to-dI galaxies. In this second paper, we study the structural relations between baryonic mass, half-mass radius, and mean surface density to constrain possible morphological transformations between star-forming and passive galaxies. We complemented the SPARC sample with $\\sim$1200 passive galaxies that are nearly devoid of gas: ellipticals (Es), lenticulars (S0s), dwarf ellipticals (dEs) or dwarf spheroidals (dSphs), and the so-called `ultra-diffuse galaxies' (UDGs). Our results can be summarised as follows: (1) passive stellar components follow four distinct relations at high statistical significance, namely (i) ellipticals plus bulges, (ii) S0 disks, (iii) non-nucleated dwarfs (dEs, dSphs, UDGs), and (iv) nucleated dEs; (2) star-forming HSD disks (mostly Sa to Sc) overlap with S0 disks within 2$σ$ in the baryonic relations and within 1$σ$ in the stellar ones, so present-day spirals may simply evolve into lenticulars as they run out of gas; (3) star-forming LSD disks (mostly Sd to dI) are offset from non-nucleated passive dwarfs at more than 3$σ$ in the baryonic relations, but the two galaxy populations overlap within 1$σ$ in the stellar relations, suggesting that non-nucleated passive dwarfs may form from star-forming dwarfs only after gas removal; (4) UDGs extend the sequence of non-nucleated dEs/dSphs and may originate from the most diffuse star-forming LSD galaxies with no need for a substantial expansion of the stellar component."}

Scherrer"], "title": "Exact general solutions for cosmological scalar field evolution in a vacuum-energy dominated expansion", "comment": "8 pages, no figures", "summary": "We derive exact general solutions (as opposed to attractor particular solutions) for the evolution of a scalar field $φ$ in a universe dominated by a background fluid with equation of state parameter $w_B = -1$, extending earlier work on exact solutions with $w_B > -1$. Straightfoward exact solutions exist when the evolution is described by a linear differential equation, corresponding to constant, linear, and quadratic potentials. In the nonlinear case, exact solutions are derived for $V = V_0\\ln φ$, $V = V_0 φ^{1/2}$ and $V = V_0/φ$, and the logarithmic potential also yields an exact first integral. These complicated parametric solutions are considerably less useful than those derived previously for a universe dominated by a barotropic fluid such as matter or radiation with $w_B > -1$. However, we generalize the slow-roll approximation and show that it applies to all sufficiently flat potentials in the case of a vacuum-dominated expansion, while it never applies when the universe is dominated by a background fluid with $w_B > -1$."}

Cluster membership was robustly determined through a probabilistic proper-motion analysis, yielding statistically significant samples of 600, 1042, and 907 stars, respectively. From the mean parallaxes of these members, we determine astrometric distances ranging from approximately 3.40 kpc for Berkeley 17 to 5.80 kpc for Berkeley 18. Isochrone fitting applied to the decontaminated color-magnitude diagrams constrains the cluster ages to 9.12 +/- 1.00 Gyr, 3.36 +/- 0.50 Gyr, and 5.10 +/- 0.50 Gyr, respectively. Interstellar reddening spans a wide range, from E(B-V) = 0.17 mag in Berkeley 39 to 0.58 mag in Berkeley 17. Structural parameters derived from King model fits to the radial density profiles, combined with mass function analyses, indicate that the clusters are dynamically relaxed systems with mass distributions broadly consistent with the canonical Salpeter slope. Our kinematic analysis reveals that Berkeley 17, Berkeley 18, and Berkeley 39 are part of the outer disk population."}

This signal can be widely interpreted as originating from a cosmic population of inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). Current PTA analyses primarily constrain the SGWB power spectrum and its auto-angular power spectrum. However, the supermassive black holes will produce an underlying correlation with the large-scale structure of the Universe, which can help in understanding the formation and evolution of the binaries. In this work, we develop a new analysis pipeline PyGxGW-PTA for studying the cross-correlation of nHz GW signal with galaxy surveys ($C^{\\rm g\\, GW}_\\ell$) and obtain the first constraint on the SGWB and galaxy distribution cross-correlation using the NANOGrav 15-year dataset in combination with the DESI galaxy catalog. We find no statistically significant correlation between the SGWB and the large-scale distribution of DESI galaxies and using an optimal estimator we put an upper bound on $C^{\\rm g\\, GW}_{\\ell=8} < 0.0083$ at $95\\%$ C.I. This yields the first observational upper limit on the spatial correlation between the nHz SGWB and the large-scale structure of the Universe, establishing the observational groundwork for future multi-tracer analyses that will combine PTA data with next-generation galaxy surveys to unveil the SMBHB-galaxy correlation."}

Our framework provides a local picture of the structural evolution of a relativistic restricted three-body problem around a deformed black hole in an adiabatically evolving binary, motivated by various astrophysical settings including disk dynamics and extreme mass-ratio inspirals. As the tidal-field strength is increased, initially regular, bound geodesics undergo four stages: (i) weak chaos emerges within the bound motion; (ii) a subset of trajectories plunges into the black hole; (iii) a fraction of the remaining trajectories becomes unbound; and (iv) no bound trajectories persist. We provide semi-analytic estimates for the critical tidal amplitudes associated with each transition. Our estimates indicate that, within the frequency band of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, the matter flow around black holes may already be depleted, whereas LISA and (B-)DECIGO could probe the earlier stages. Our results suggest that an object orbiting a tidally deformed massive BH may remain near resonances over a wide range of separations, indicating an accumulated, non-negligible impact on the gravitational-wave phase. Tidal perturbations can also introduce nonlinear couplings among epicyclic oscillations of geodesics, offering a potential avenue to resonant excitation of quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray light curves from accreting black holes."}
