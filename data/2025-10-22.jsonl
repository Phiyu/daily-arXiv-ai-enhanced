These objects exhibit\nunusual spectral features reminiscent of stellar spectra with blackbody-like\nSEDs, large hydrogen Balmer breaks, Balmer line absorption, and classical\nstellar absorption features such as calcium H&K and the calcium triplet.\nFollowing the recent suggestion that these may be actively accreting\ndirect-collapse black holes in the process of assembly, i.e. quasi-stars, we\npresent evolutionary models of quasi-stars using our recently released,\npublicly available MESA-QUEST modeling framework. We compute a grid of models\nspanning a range of black hole masses and predict the luminosities,\ntemperatures, surface gravities, and lifetimes of these objects. We find that\nthese models lie along a Hayashi track once they hit their ``late-stage'' which\nconstitutes the majority of their lives ($\\sim 20$~Myr). We present scaling\nrelations for estimating the mass of a quasi-star as a function of the\nbolometric luminosity, as well as the bolometric luminosity as a function of\nthe effective temperature for the Hayashi track. The short lifetimes in tandem\nwith the observed number density of LRDs imply the possibility that every\nsupermassive black hole was once a quasi-star. We compare synthetic spectra of\nour quasi-star models to observations of LRDs, and show that these models are\nbroadly capable of reproducing the continuum spectra of observed LRDs. These\nresults indicate that quasi-stars are promising candidates for the origin of\nsupermassive black holes via direct collapse in the early universe."}

Using the large-volume FLAMINGO hydrodynamical\nsimulations, we examine the role of both central and satellite supermassive\nblack holes (BHs) in shaping this scatter, probing higher halo masses than\npreviously possible. For haloes with M500 < 10^13 Msun, we find that central BH\nmass correlates strongly and negatively with gas fraction, such that higher BH\nmasses give rise to lower gas fractions at fixed halo mass, consistent with\nprevious studies. Interestingly, however, for 10^13 Msun < M500 < 10^14.5 Msun\nthe correlation reverses and becomes positive, with overmassive BHs residing in\nhaloes with above-average gas fractions. By tracing progenitor BHs and haloes\nthrough cosmic time, we show that this behaviour is driven by the expulsion and\nsubsequent re-accretion of halo gas, regulated by the timing of BH growth and\nfeedback. Specifically, haloes that collapse earlier form BHs earlier, leading\nto earlier gas expulsion and re-accretion and a high gas fraction compared to\nhaloes of the same present-day mass that formed later.

For the\nfirst time, we have directly measured a relatively continuous escape velocity\ncurve that can extend to Galactocentric radii of $\\sim 50$ kpc, finding a\ndecline in agreement with previous studies. The escape velocity at the solar\nposition yielded by our measurements is $523.74^{+12.83}_{-13.47}\\;\\rm{km\ns^{-1}}$. Combined with the local circular velocity, we estimated the mass of\nthe MW assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White DM profile, which resulted in a total\nmass of $M_{200,\\;\\rm{total}}=0.90_{-0.07}^{+0.06}\\times 10^{12}\\;M_{\\odot}$,\nwith a concentration of $c_{200}=13.47_{-1.70}^{+1.85}$. The small uncertainty\nimplies that including the escape velocities beyond the solar neighborhood can\nresult in a more precise mass estimate. Our derived MW mass is consistent with\nsome recent studies using the escape velocity as well as other tracers, which\nmay support a lower mass of the DM halo than in the past."}

To isolate the impact\nof hydrodynamical solvers on jet evolution, we compare idealised jets and their\nremnants in uniform and stratified media across resolutions and jet parameters.\nIn uniform media, all jets drive bow shocks, inflate hot lobes, exhibit\nbackflows, and evolve self-similarly. For the parameters explored, SWIFT lobes\nare shorter, wider, and hotter; AREPO lobes are longer, thinner, and cooler;\nwhile PLUTO lobes display complex flows with intermediate characteristics. In\nstratified media, jets deviate from self-similar evolution, inflating longer\nand thinner lobes due to lower external ram pressure. After switch-off, SWIFT\njets evolve into smooth cylindrical bubbles, AREPO jets produce long\nfilamentary remnants, and PLUTO jets yield intermediate-length remnants with\nvarying degrees of mixing. Despite such differences, all jets and remnants have\na similar impact on the ambient medium.

Approximately $17\\%$ of the\ndouble-peaked LAEs are blue-dominated, suggesting gas inflows. The\nblue-to-total flux ratio exhibits a luminosity dependence: fainter lines\ngenerally show higher blue flux, though some luminous sources also show strong\nblue peaks. We find a narrowing of the red peak at $z > 4$, despite the\npresence of the blue peak, indicating intrinsic galaxy evolution rather than\nIGM attenuation. Several LAEs exhibit residual flux in the absorption trough,\nwith normalised trough flux anticorrelating with peak separation, reflecting\nvariations in HI column density. We further investigate spatially resolved\nproperties of ten red-dominated LAEs with extended Ly$\\alpha$ halos. Despite\nazimuthal variations, both the blue-to-total flux ratio and normalised trough\nflux density increase with radius, while peak separation decreases. The red\npeak asymmetry shows only minor radial changes. These trends are consistent\nwith variations in shell outflow velocity and HI column density across the\nhalos. Based on peak separation, red peak asymmetry, and residual trough flux,\nwe identify five LAEs as strong LyC-leaker candidates."}

While several modern cosmological simulations use the gas\nfraction-halo mass relation to calibrate their feedback implementations, we\nnote that this relation exhibits substantial intrinsic scatter whose origin has\nnot been fully elucidated. Using the large-volume FLAMINGO hydrodynamical\nsimulations, we examine the role of both central and satellite supermassive\nblack holes (BHs) in shaping this scatter, probing higher halo masses than\npreviously possible. For haloes with M500 < 10^13 Msun, we find that central BH\nmass correlates strongly and negatively with gas fraction, such that higher BH\nmasses give rise to lower gas fractions at fixed halo mass, consistent with\nprevious studies. Interestingly, however, for 10^13 Msun < M500 < 10^14.5 Msun\nthe correlation reverses and becomes positive, with overmassive BHs residing in\nhaloes with above-average gas fractions. By tracing progenitor BHs and haloes\nthrough cosmic time, we show that this behaviour is driven by the expulsion and\nsubsequent re-accretion of halo gas, regulated by the timing of BH growth and\nfeedback. Specifically, haloes that collapse earlier form BHs earlier, leading\nto earlier gas expulsion and re-accretion and a high gas fraction compared to\nhaloes of the same present-day mass that formed later. Our results demonstrate\nthat present-day scatter in the gas fraction-halo mass relation is strongly\nshaped by the early growth history of BHs and their haloes, a prediction that\ncan be tested with future observational measurements."}

In this study we\nexplore the viability of using Minkowski functionals (MFs) as a robustness test\nto validate a potential $r$ detection by identifying non-Gaussian features\nassociated with foregrounds contamination. To do so, we simulate sky maps as\nobserved by a LiteBIRD-like CMB experiment, with realistic instrumental and\nforegrounds modelling. The CMB $B$-mode signal is recovered through blind\ncomponent separation algorithms, and the obtained (biased) value of $r$ is used\nto generate Gaussian realisation of CMB signal.

Our results\ndemonstrate that, with the experimental configuration considered here, MFs can\nnot be reliably adopted as a robustness test of an eventual $r$ detection, as\nwe find that in the majority of the cases MFs are not able to raise significant\nwarnings about the non-Gaussianity induced by the presence of foreground\nresiduals.

In both cases, the dynamics introduce a nonextensivity parameter\n$\\delta$, with the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area relation recovered\nfor $\\delta = 1$. While previous studies have suggested that only small\ndeviations from extensivity are observationally allowed, typically requiring\n$|1 - \\delta| \\lesssim 10^{-3}$, here we go further and perform a systematic\nconsistency analysis across the entire expansion history.\n  We show that even mild departures from $\\delta = 1$ lead to pathological\nbehavior in the effective dark energy sector: its density can become negative\nor complex, its equation of state may diverge, or it can contribute an\nunacceptably large early-time fraction that spoils radiation domination and\nviolates BBN and CMB constraints. Our results sharpen and unify earlier hints\nof tension, providing a clear physical interpretation in terms of corrections\nthat grow uncontrollably with the expansion rate toward the past.\n  We conclude that within both the Cai-Kim and HDE formulations, a viable\ncosmology emerges only in the extensive limit, effectively reducing the models\nto $\\Lambda$CDM. More broadly, our findings emphasize the importance of\ndynamical consistency and cosmological viability tests, when assessing\nnonextensive entropy formalisms as potential frameworks for describing the\nUniverse's dynamics."}

During the AdS-like CC ($\\Lambda_{\\rm s}<0$) phase, prior to\nthe transition redshift $z_\\dagger$, reduced Hubble friction dynamically\nenhances the growth of perturbations; after the switch, with dS-like CC\n($\\Lambda_{\\rm s}>0$), the larger late-time expansion rate partly suppresses,\nbut does not erase, the earlier amplification. Consequently, the ratio\n$P_{\\Lambda_{\\rm s}\\rm CDM}/P_{\\Lambda\\rm CDM}$ exhibits a pronounced,\nredshift-dependent shape feature: a crest peaking at ${\\sim 20-25\\%}$ around\n${k \\simeq 1-3\\,h\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$ near the transition, which then migrates\nto larger physical scales and persists to ${z = 0}$ as a robust ${\\sim\n15-20\\%}$ uplift at ${k \\simeq 0.6-1.0\\,h\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$. These\nwavenumbers correspond to group/poor-cluster environments and lie within the\nsensitivity range of weak lensing, galaxy-galaxy lensing, cluster counts, and\ntSZ power, providing a concrete, falsifiable target that cannot be mimicked by\na scale-independent change in $\\sigma_8$ or $S_8$. The timing (earlier for\nPlanck-only, later for the full dataset) and the amplitude of the crest align\nwith the ''cosmic noon'' epoch (${z \\simeq 1-2}$), offering a gravitational\nprior for the observed peak in the cosmic star-formation rate."}

By analyzing the latest observations from the Atacama\nCosmology Telescope (ACT)~\\cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim}, we demonstrate that\nthe observed preference for positive running ($\\alpha_s$) of the scalar\nspectral index $n_s$ imposes significant restrictions on the parameter space of\nultra slow roll scenarios (USR). This tension becomes progressively pronounced\nfor more massive PBHs, posing substantial challenges for USR models to yield a\ndetectable PBH abundance, especially in the mass range probed by ongoing and\nfuture gravitational-wave experiments such as LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) and the\nEinstein Telescope (ET). However, this discrepancy is minimal for asteroid-mass\nPBHs, which are still capable of feasibly constituting the entirety of dark\nmatter (DM). To numerically probe the six-dimensional parameter space of\npolynomial models, we adapted a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to\nefficiently scan over the space of viable models. Our results further indicate\nthat, in non-minimally coupled polynomial inflation, a viable cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) spectrum is best obtained at an inflection point for which\nsecond-order slow-roll approximation is necessary for precise CMB predictions."}
