Building on the theoretical framework of Paper I, where we demonstrated that non-linearities inevitably redistribute power from small to large scales through mode mixing, we confront these predictions with current cosmological data. We modify the CLASS Boltzmann code to incorporate a white noise component $k_\\mathrm{BH}/k$ in the primordial power spectrum and perform parameter estimation using current cosmological data. The non-detection of excess power on the largest observable scales places stringent upper bounds: $k_\\mathrm{BH} \\leq 1.80 \\times 10^{-13}~\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at 99\\% confidence. These constraints imply the primordial power spectrum must deviate from perfect scale invariance on small scales, either through a cutoff at $k_{\\mathrm{cut}} \\lesssim 3~\\mathrm{pc}^{-1}$ or through running of the spectral index with $α_s \\lesssim -0.015$.

We combine the bounds derived from the positivity of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics with observational constraints on the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) and Barboza-Alcaniz (BA) parameterizations of the equation of state (EoS) of the component. We use Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) data from Pantheon+; baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from DESI DR2; and cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements from Planck. For $α>0$ (particle creation), the thermodynamic restrictions yield only upper limits for the $μ_{0}n_{0}$ product, while in the case of $α<0$ (particle destruction) they establish both upper and lower limits, allowing for a range of values to be obtained. In both scenarios, however, we find that the chemical potential of dark energy must be negative, $μ<0$, which indicates a preference for the phantom regime. In particular, when $α<0$, it is noted that the thermodynamic bounds are simultaneously compatible only for very small absolute values of $α$, with $α=-0.0002$ being the limiting case and resulting in $μ_{0}n_{0}(α=-0.0002)=-2.2_{-0.7}^{+1.0}\\,\\,GeV/m^{3}$."}

In particular, DESI favors dark energy whose equation of state parameter can drop below $-1$, violating the null energy condition. Chen and Loeb have recently suggested that this violation may be avoided if a subcomponent of the dark matter possesses a time-dependent equation of state. In this work, we present a renormalizable realization of that idea, which can be regarded as a more natural effective field theory. We show that such a construction not only yields dark matter with a time-varying equation of state parameter, but also naturally produces a self-interacting dark matter candidate with a velocity-dependent cross section as a consequence of gauge invariance. The second feature is relevant for addressing tensions between $Λ$CDM and observations of small-scale structure, particularly the diversity of galactic rotation curves. Even if further study ultimately finds our fiducial model to be disfavored, this work is valuable for constraining the space of renormalizable, natural models that have the potential to realize the behavior desired by Chen and Loeb."}

However it is possible such forces act on dark matter, as it is less constrained observationally. In this work, we consider dark matter to be made of light bosons, such as axions. We introduce a mediator that communicates a new force between dark matter particles, in addition to gravity. The mediator is taken to be light, but not massless, so that it can affect small scale galactic behavior, but not current cosmological behavior. As a concrete application of this idea, we analyze the effects on scalar dark matter solitons bound by gravitation, i.e., boson stars, which have been claimed to potentially provide cores of galaxies. We numerically determine the soliton's profiles in the presence of this new force. We also extend the analysis to multiple mediators. We show that this new force alters the relation between core density and core radius in a way that can provide improvement in fitting data to observed galactic cores, but for couplings of order the gravitational strength, the improvement is only modest."}

Oxygen- versus iron-dependent cosmic star formation history", "comment": null, "summary": "Due to their different nucleosynthetic origin, a stellar population produces oxygen (O) and iron (Fe) on different timescales and their relative abundance can deviate strongly from solar. Galaxy formation models should treat these elements separately, as they play a distinct role in shaping physical phenomena. For example, oxygen mainly sets the gas cooling rate, while the iron abundance sets stellar atmosphere opacities impacting stellar evolution, spectra and feedback. Observations of star-forming galaxies usually only constrain gas-phase oxygen abundance, vastly limiting our capabilities of separating the cosmic evolution of oxygen and iron. Here, we present an observationally-motivated framework to scale the cosmic evolution of O and Fe abundances. We apply the relation between the alpha-enhancement and galaxies' specific star formation rate ([O/Fe]-sSFR; Chruslinska et al. 2024) to derive the Fe and O-dependent cosmic star formation history (cSFH). We find that star formation with near-solar O/Fe is rare: at least 70% of the integrated cosmic stellar mass forms at non-solar O/Fe. The cosmic average metallicity is generally lower in [Fe/H] than in [O/H] (by up to a factor 3), with the offset increasing from redshifts z=0 to z~3 and then approaching the core-collapse O/Fe ratio. We validate our results against samples that probe the Fe-dependent cSFH in different regimes such as absorption-derived <[Fe/H]> from long gamma-ray bursts. Our results impact the interpretations of stellar and galaxy spectra and the predicted rates of transients, especially those linked to metal-poor progenitors (e.g., black hole mergers)."}

Parameter inference is performed with Cobaya, and the cosmological and modified-gravity parameters are sampled within the emulator training domain, which is jointly fitted with the systematic parameters.

The physical reason for their large magnitude gap (dm12) may arise from early FG formation, which allowed all L galaxies to merge with the central one, and/or it could be related to the fact that galaxies accreting on the FGs move on radial orbits, shortening their merging timescales. The latter properties could be linked with the peculiar position of FGs within the cosmic web. We determine the velocity anisotropy profile beta(r) of the fossil cluster A267, which is related to the orbital distribution of cluster galaxies. This is the first individual FG for which the orbital distribution of galaxies is determined. We aim to confirm previous findings based on stack samples that indicate that FGs, on average, host galaxies on more radial orbits than normal clusters. We started with a sample of 2315 redshifts in the field of A267 and we determined the membership for 329 of them. Of these, 174 are located within r200. We used them as tracers of the gravitational potential of the cluster to solve the Jeans equation using the MAMPOSSt algorithm. We thus obtained the cluster mass M(r) and beta(r) profiles. We also estimated M(r) from the X-ray data. A comparison of the MAMPOSSt and X-ray-determined M(r)s allows us to estimate the cluster hydrostatic mass bias, that is consistent with previous findings. The anisotropy parameter beta(r) indicates tangential orbits for the galaxies near the cluster centre and increasingly radial orbits in the external regions. We therefore confirm that FGs are characterised by more radial orbits for their member galaxies than the average cluster population. We speculate that this different orbital distribution might be an important element in creating a large dm12."}

This physical scenario calls for two additional parameters with respect to the ΛCDM model, one of which is the equation of state parameter of the created dark energy. The model is constrained by the requirement that its deceleration parameter coincides with the one predicted by the ΛCDM model. Then, we construct the effective running Hubble constant, a theoretical function that corresponds to the ratio of the Hubble parameter in our model to the ΛCDM expansion rate. The model's theoretical predictions for the effective running Hubble constant are compared with the binned data of the Supernovae Ia Master Sample. The comparison is performed by a MCMC procedure for each bin, with three parameters left free to vary, while the particle creation rate is taken from a grid of values, each of which is fixed in the given MCMC run. The most important result emerging from this analysis is that the created dark energy constituent corresponds to an equation of state parameter with phantom character. Only if particle creation is removed do the dark energy constituents acquire a quintessence character. No matter the intrinsic nature of the constituents, their effective z-dependent equation of state parameter is, both with and without considering particle creation, entirely of phantom nature across the considered redshift range."}

We focus on the properties and environment of host galaxies, and their evolution down to z=0, with the aim of assessing how well the bright high redshift QSOs population traces the progenitors of most massive haloes in the local Universe. Our results show that at z>6 bright QSOs live in a variety of environments, and that secular processes like disc instability are responsible for triggering roughly the same number of QSOs as galaxy mergers. Half of cubic (7.5 $h^{-1}$ cMpc size) mock fields built around these high-z QSOs include other active galaxies (with L$_{\\rm bolo}$>10$^{44}$ erg/s) in sizeable number, the other host galaxies being relatively isolated. The large field-to-field variance in the the number of companions (both active and non-active) recently reported from JWST observations is fairly well reproduced by GAEA predictions. Descendants of host galaxies at z=0 cover a wide range of physical properties and environments with only a small fraction of the hosts of high-z QSOs ending up in massive galaxy clusters.

Therefore, an independent probe for these kinds of DE-DM interactions would be appealing from observational aspects. In this paper, we propose the black hole superradiance as a novel astrophysical probe for field-theoretic interacting DE-DM models, providing complementary constraints independent of large-scale cosmological observations. The core principle is that the DE-DM interaction can alter the effective mass of the superradiant ultralight boson, thereby modifying its superradiant instability rate around spinning black holes. We explore this connection through two distinct scenarios: a model where the DE field mediates a dark fifth force within the DM sector, affecting the superradiance from DM particles; and a novel mechanism where the DE field itself becomes superradiant due to the effective mass enhancement induced by dense DM spikes around supermassive black holes. By applying a statistical framework to black hole observations in both scenarios, we derive constraints on the fundamental DE-DM coupling strength. Although the current constraints are rather loose due to small samples and inaccurate measurements, our work provides new astrophysical constraints on these interacting DE-DM scenarios and establishes a new synergy between black hole physics and cosmology for probing the fundamental nature of the dark sector."}

Observational tests of this scenario rely on determining outflow masses, which requires measuring the electron density ($n_e$) of ionised gas. However, recent studies have argued that the most commonly used diagnostic may underestimate electron densities (and hence overestimate outflow masses) by several orders of magnitude, casting doubt as to whether ionised AGN-driven outflows can provide the impact needed to reconcile observations with theory. Here, we investigate this by applying two different electron-density diagnostics to Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopy of the Quasar Feedback (QSOFEED) sample of 48 nearby type-2 quasars. Accounting for uncertainties, we find that outflow masses implied by the transauroral-line electron-density diagnostic are significantly lower than those produced by the commonly-used `strong-line' [S II](6717/6731) method, indicating a different origin of these emission lines and suggesting that these doubts are justified. Nevertheless, we show that it is possible to modify the [S II](6717/6731) electron-density diagnostic for our sample by applying a correction of $\\mathrm{log}_{10}(n_{e\\mathrm{,\\, outflow}}\\mathrm{ [cm}^{-3}\\mathrm{]}) = \\mathrm{log}_{10}(n_{e\\mathrm{,[S\\,II]}}\\mathrm{ [cm}^{-3}\\mathrm{]}) + 0.75(\\pm0.07)$ to account for this, which results in values that are statistically consistent with those produced using the transauroral-line method.

The frequency dependence of optical depths in the 40 lines of Lyman series of HI and HeII, and in 10 lines of HeI, as well as in their continuums were computed in order to estimate the spectral flux of radiation from halos virialized during Cosmic Dawn and Reionization epochs. Assuming the thermal continuous spectra with virialized temperature of halos with dwarf galaxy mass $\\sim10^9$ M$_\\odot$, we compute the spectral fluxes from such halos in the vicinity of our galaxy taking into account the cosmological distances, redshifts and absorptions by each absorber and all together. The obtained spectral transmittance functions of intergalactic medium, $S(λ;z)$, are analysed on the subject which absorber systems of HI, HeI and HeII are corresponding for formation of troughs in the continuous spectra of sources at redshift range $5-15$ and how it depends on reionization history.

Increasing Pa$α$ and H$α$ EW profiles with galactocentric radius across all stellar masses probed provide direct evidence for the inside-out growth of galaxies both via dust-obscured and unobscured star formation for the first time.

The most dominant contaminant in the WL effect is the shape noise; the signal is diluted due to the finite number of source galaxies. In order to explore the full potential of WL measurements, sharpening the signal by removing the shape noise from the observational data, i.e., WL denoising, is a pressing issue. Machine learning approaches, in particular, deep generative models, have proven effective at the WL denoising task. We implement a denoising model based on the diffusion model (DM) and conduct systematic in-depth comparisons with generative adversarial networks (GANs), which have been applied in previous works for WL denoising. Utilizing the large suite of mock simulations of WL observations, we demonstrate that DM surpasses GAN in the WL denosing task in multiple aspects: (1) the training process is more stable, (2) taking the average of multiple samples from DM can robustly reproduce the true signal, and (3) DM can recover various statistics with higher accuracy."}

Employing this modified equipartition law of energy, we derive the Friedmann equations in Verlinde's entropic gravity. We find a maximum energy density at the beginning of the Universe. Remarkably, this feature emerges not only for positive GUP parameter but also for negative GUP parameter. From the initial acceleration, we deduce that the negative GUP parameter is more preferable. We also obtain maximum Hubble parameter from the first Friedmann equation, indicating a universe without initial singularity. Moreover, we compute the Kretschmann curvature scalar, again indicating a non-singular universe. Interestingly, we find that GUP-modified Friedmann equations share some similarities with braneworld cosmolgy where the quadratic term in energy density appears.

The collapse of the galaxy HI Mass Function in Fornax", "comment": "Accepted in Astronomy & Astrophysics. 12 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "We present the deepest HI mass Function (HIMF) ever measured, outside the Local Group. The observations are part of the MeerKAT Fornax Survey and cover a 4 x 4 deg^2 field, corresponding to ~ Rvir. The 3$σ$ detection limit is log(MHI/Msun) = 5.7 for a 50 km/s-wide point source. We detect HI in 35 galaxies and 44 clouds with no optical counterparts. Using deep optical images from the Fornax Deep Survey, we show that the clouds are a distinct population, separated by a four magnitude gap from the faintest HI-detected galaxies. The majority (33 out of 44) of the clouds are associated with the two galaxies with the most HI in the cluster -- NGC 1365 and NGC 1427A, although the clouds contribute a negligible amount to the total MHI budget. By performing a SNR analysis and computing the Rauzy statistic on the HI detections, we demonstrate that our catalogue is complete down log(MHI/Msun) = 6, and we are therefore able to probe the HIMF down to this level. We find an abrupt drop of the number density of HI-detected galaxies at log(MHI/Msun) = 7, signifying a clear absence of galaxies between 6 < log(MHI/Msun) < 7. We use the modified maximum likelihood method to fit a Schechter function down to log(MHI/Msun) > 7, the range where the HIMF follows a power-law. The measured low-mass slope is $α$ = -1.31 $\\pm$ 0.13, with a characteristic knee mass of log(M*/Msun) = 10.52 $\\pm$ 1.89. The low-mass slope matches the slope in the field, while the knee is defined by a single galaxy and is unconstrained. Below log(MHI/Msun) = 7, there is a sharp departure from a Schechter function, and we report the first robust measurement of the collapse of a HIMF. For the HIMF below log(MHI/Msun) = 7 to follow a power-law, tens of galaxies are needed -- a factor ~ six higher than what is observed. The collapse of the Fornax HIMF is likely due to the rapid removal of HI from low-mass galaxies."}

In this framework, the interacting subcomponent of dark matter is in thermal equilibrium with the dark radiation in the early universe, but decouples from it around the time of matter-radiation equality. We study this general class of models and evaluate the quality of fit to recent cosmological data on the cosmic microwave background (from Planck 2018 and ACT DR6), baryon acoustic oscillations, large-scale structure, supernovae type Ia, and Cepheid variables. We focus on three benchmark scenarios that differ in the rate at which the dark matter decouples from the dark radiation, resulting in different patterns of dark acoustic oscillations. Fitting without ACT DR6 data, we find that all three scenarios significantly reduce the Hubble tension relative to $Λ$CDM, with an exponentially fast decoupling being the most preferred. The tension is reduced to less than $2 \\, σ$ in fits that don't include the SH0ES collaboration results as part of the data and to less than $1 \\, σ$ when these are included. When ACT DR6 data is included, the fit is significantly worsened. We find that the largest $H_0$ value at the $95 \\%$ confidence region is $70.1$ km/s/Mpc without the SH0ES data, leading to only a mild reduction in the tension. This increases to $72.5$ km/s/Mpc, corresponding to a reduction in the tension to less than $3 \\, σ$, if the SH0ES results are included in the fit."}

Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics (A&A)", "summary": "We analyzed the spatial distribution of globular cluster (GC) systems across 37 host galaxies in a two dimensional parameter space defined by projected galactocentric distance Rg and metallicity Fe/H. We identified a universal triangular depleted region characterized by a lack of metal poor GCs in the inner parts of host galaxies. The morphology of this depleted region correlates with the luminous mass of the host galaxies; more massive galaxies consistently exhibit more extended depleted regions. We attribute this phenomenon to the combined influence of large scale galactic assembly and internal GC dynamics, particularly the initial retention of black holes within GCs. Metal poor GCs contain a more massive and compact black hole subsystem, which drives more energetic few body encounters and injects greater kinetic energy into the stellar population. This extra energy, combined with strong tidal forces in central galactic regions, accelerates the dissolution of low metallicity GCs, producing the triangular depleted pattern in the Rg - Fe/H space. Stronger tidal fields in more massive galaxies confine surviving metal poor GCs to larger radii, broadening the depleted region. The morphology of this region may serve as a potential distance indicator for host galaxies. Our results also suggest that scenarios with substantial black hole natal kicks are unlikely, as too few retained black holes would erase the metallicity dependent cluster dissolution required to form the observed depletion region."}

In the $w_0w_a$CDM model with EDE, a quintessence-like component ($w_0+w_a\\geq-1$) can be 1$σ$ consistent with Planck+ACT+SPT+DESI+Pantheon+SH0ES datasets, and $Δχ^2\\lesssim -14$ compared with $w_0w_a$CDM model without EDE.

Progress has been made in the covariant formulation of LQG, but the tools do not carry over to the canonical formulation. These tools are graphical by nature, describing space with spin networks to make calculations in LQG more intuitive to the human hand.\n  Recently, a new notation for working with spin networks has been used by arXiv:2412.20272 to offer the first accurate numerical results in canonical LQG by allowing the underlying graphs to change throughout the calculation, though they are forced to concede visual intuitiveness. In this thesis, we offer a more radical rephrasing of spin network calculations by translating them into the finite-dimensional ZX-calculus, extending previous attempts to translate into the standard (qubit) ZX-calculus (arXiv:2111.03114). Specifically, we derive the mixed-dimensional ZX-diagrams representing the generating objects of spin networks and the rules for the Penrose Spin Calculus (arXiv:2511.06012), and use these to present the ZX-form and correctness of \"loop removal\". We also derive the forms for several fundamental LQG objects in the finite-dimensional ZX-calculus for the first time. This gives us a high-level, intuitive graphical language that retains a flexibility to handle changing graph structures, and thus we argue positions the PSC as the new definitive language for canonical LQG.\n  Furthermore, we investigate the possibility for a matrix-like normal form for spin networks deriving from a novel perspective of the PSC in terms of W-nodes."}

The ability of the smallest dark matter halos to form stars depends sensitively on the balance between gas cooling and reionization heating. To quantify how this balance shapes the abundance and properties of the faintest galaxies, we compare two model variants: a fiducial model that includes molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) cooling and UV background radiation, and a No-H$_2$ model with atomic cooling only. Both models reproduce the structural properties of brighter Milky Way satellites, but they diverge at the lowest luminosities in the hyper-faint regime. The fiducial model predicts a substantially larger population of such systems that are on average hosted in halos with lower peak masses and quenched earlier. Many of these predicted systems lie below current observational thresholds but are within reach of next-generation deep imaging surveys. The predicted size-luminosity distributions of both models overlap with the region occupied by recently discovered \"ambiguous\" systems, whose classification as galaxies or star clusters remains uncertain. Specifically, we find that hyper-faint satellites have line-of-sight velocity dispersions of $σ_{\\rm los} \\sim 1-3$ km/s in the fiducial model, nearly an order of magnitude higher than expected for purely self-gravitating stellar systems of the same stellar mass. This distinction underscores the diagnostic power of precise kinematic measurements for determining whether ambiguous objects are dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies or star clusters, and highlights the importance of upcoming spectroscopic campaigns in resolving the nature of the faintest satellites."}

We focus on the properties and environment of host galaxies, and their evolution down to z=0, with the aim of assessing how well the bright high redshift QSOs population traces the progenitors of most massive haloes in the local Universe. Our results show that at z>6 bright QSOs live in a variety of environments, and that secular processes like disc instability are responsible for triggering roughly the same number of QSOs as galaxy mergers. Half of cubic (7.5 $h^{-1}$ cMpc size) mock fields built around these high-z QSOs include other active galaxies (with L$_{\\rm bolo}$>10$^{44}$ erg/s) in sizeable number, the other host galaxies being relatively isolated.

Descendants of host galaxies at z=0 cover a wide range of physical properties and environments with only a small fraction of the hosts of high-z QSOs ending up in massive galaxy clusters. Viceversa, GAEA predicts that only a small fraction of Bright Central Galaxies have a bright z>6 QSOs among their progenitors.

Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics", "summary": "We report the results of the optical follow-up of a sample of $γ$-ray-emitting active galactic nuclei (AGN). New high-quality optical spectra were obtained using Gran Telescopio Canarias with Optical System for Imaging and low- Intermediate-Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy and the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope Unit Telescope 1 with the FOcal Reducer and low dispersion Spectrograph 2. From the analysis of these spectra, we confirmed the previous classification as narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) for four objects and discovered two new NLS1s, bringing the total number of optically confirmed $γ$-NLS1s to 26. We also identified two ambiguous cases between NLS1 and intermediate Seyfert (IS), three IS, one broad-line Seyfert 1, one Seyfert 2. Based on the new spectra, we calculated black hole masses ranging from $10^{6.25}$ to $10^{9.32}$ $M_\\odot$, and Eddington ratios spanning 0.05 to 2.07. This reclassification reinforces the scenario in which AGN with relatively small black hole masses are capable of launching powerful relativistic jets, contributing to our broader understanding of $γ$-ray-emitting AGN."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "We introduce a new, non-parametric method for estimating the mass enclosed within a sphere of arbitrary radius centered on the Sun. The method is based on the divergence theorem as applied to measurements of the line-of-sight accelerations of millisecond pulsars. We describe a procedure for inferring the mean mass density within a sphere of a given radius centered on the Sun and find results that are consistent with previous analyses. When combined with a model for the distribution of baryons, this provides the mean mass density of dark matter as a function of distance from the Sun, rather than a single value as is typically reported by kinematic studies. However, with the present pulsar data, the method cannot unambiguously measure a signal from the local distribution of dark matter at this time; such a measurement is expected to soon become possible as the amount of pulsar acceleration data grows and its precision improves. We derive an extension of the well-known shell theorem to a spherical-harmonics expansion of the density and potential, and use the result to obtain estimates for density asymmetries with respect to the Galactic midplane from the observed acceleration data. The predicted asymmetries do not follow the observed distribution of MW disk stars or gas; this can potentially be explained by a non-uniform distribution of dark matter in the Solar neighborhood."}

However, because of the opacity of the intergalactic medium, it is often not possible to make direct measurements of the ionizing photon escape fraction ($f_{\\mathrm{esc}}^{\\: \\mathrm{LyC}}$) of high-redshift ($z \\gtrsim 4$) galaxies. To explore the agreement and systematics of common indirect approaches, we applied six empirically calibrated diagnostics to predict $f_{\\mathrm{esc}}^{\\: \\mathrm{LyC}}$ for the 45 nearby star-forming galaxies from the COS Legacy Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY). These methods- based on ultraviolet (UV) absorption lines, the UV continuum slope, Ly$α$ kinematics, a multivariate model, radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, and nebular emission line ratios- enable us to explore systematic differences between predictions and assess how galactic properties influence inferred LyC escape. Despite significant variations in method predictions, there is broad consistency in the resulting weak and strong LyC leaker classifications, with approximately half exhibiting predicted escape fractions $>$1%. We find evidence for two different pathways of LyC escape in nearby star-forming galaxies: (1) an early escape model driven by very young stellar populations, and (2) a delayed escape model that is consistent with supernova-driven outflows and time-dependent ISM clearing. The early escape model is favored among galaxies with a single, intense burst of recent star formation. In contrast, the delayed escape model is common among galaxies with more extended starburst histories. To interpret ionizing photon escape during the EoR, it will be necessary to recognize and understand this diversity in LyC escape mechanisms."}

Following up on our initial detection of CRXH$_2$ emissions from B68 (Bialy et al. 2025), we now exploit JWST's sensitivity and spatial multiplexing to map CRXH$_2$ rovibrational lines across 16 sight lines through the cloud. By disentangling the CRXH$_2$ and UV-pumped H$_2$ components, we isolate the para-H$_2$-dominated spectrum attributable to cosmic-ray excitation. We find that there are significant spatial variations in the ratio of the CRXH$_2$ line intensity to the line-of-sight H$_2$ column density; these cannot be accounted for by dust extinction alone and demonstrate a clear attenuation of the cosmic-ray flux with increasing shielding column. Modeling B68 as a Bonnor-Ebert sphere, we constrain both the unshielded cosmic-ray ionization rate, $ζ_{\\rm H_2}$, and how it decreases with shielding column. At a reference depth of $N({\\rm H}_2) = 3 \\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, we infer $ζ_{\\rm H_2} \\approx 1.4 \\times 10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$, a factor of $\\approx 3$ higher than the average value derived from H$_3^+$ absorption studies.

An application of this result to black hole (BH) physics allows one to estimate a new quantum limit to general relativity. It is indeed shown that, for every real Schwarzschild BH, the maximum gravitational acceleration occurs, without becoming infinite, when the Schwarzschild radial coordinate reaches the gravitational radius. This means that quantum corrections to general relativity become necessary not at the Planck scale, as the majority of researchers in the field think, but at the Schwarzschild scale, in agreement with recent interesting results in the literature. In other words, the quantum nature of physics, which in this case manifests itself through the GUP, appears to prohibit the existence of real singularities, in this current case forbiddiing the gravitational acceleration of a Schwarzschild BH from becoming infinite."}

Luminosity functions are estimated using the $1/V_{\\textrm{max}}$ method, accounting for photometric redshift and magnitude errors, and validated against mock data. We find good agreement between observations and models at $z < 1$, with increasing discrepancies at higher redshifts due to photometric redshift outliers. The bright-end of the luminosity function becomes flatter at high redshift, primarily driven by redshift errors. We show that the faint-end of the luminosity function becomes more incomplete with increasing redshift, but is still useful for constraining models. We analyze the red and blue galaxy populations separately, observing distinct evolutionary trends. The model overpredicts the number of both faint red and blue galaxies. Our study highlights the importance of accurate redshift estimation and selection modeling for robust luminosity function recovery, and demonstrates that PAUS can characterise the galaxy population with photometric redshifts across a wide redshift baseline."}

Bars impose a non-axisymmetric perturbation to the rotating disk and transport gas inward to feed central starburst and, possibly, the activity of the nuclear supermassive black hole. They are believed to be long-lived structures and are now identified at redshift $z>2$. Yet, little is known about the onset and effect of bars in the early cosmic epoch because spectroscopy of distant bars at sufficient resolution is prohibitively expensive. Here, we report a kinematic study of a galactic bar at redshift 2.467, 2.6 billion years after the Big Bang. We observe the carbon monoxide and atomic carbon emission lines of the dusty star-forming galaxy J0107a and find the bar of J0107a has gas distribution and motion in a pattern identical to local bars. At the same time, the bar drives large-scale non-circular motions that dominate over disk rotation, funneling molecular gas into its center at a rate of $\\approx600$ solar masses per year.

We use long-term photometric and spectroscopic observations of three local LRDs spanning $\\sim 20$ years to measure variability in their rest-frame optical continuum and broad H$α$ emission lines. Using ZTF light curves over a rest-frame $\\sim 5$ yr baseline, the $r$-band intrinsic rms variability is $(9\\times 10^{-5})_{\\rm -9E-5}^{+0.014}$ mag (J1022), $0.025\\pm0.004$ mag (J1025) and $0.020\\pm0.005$ mag (J1047), indicating low intrinsic variability ($<3-4\\%$ at 3$σ$). These rms variability amplitudes are much lower than those for dwarf AGNs and more massive quasars. There is little structure in the optical variability structure functions for the three local LRDs, in contrast to normal AGN variability. Using available multi-epoch spectra, we constrain the broad H$α$ line flux variability to be less than a few percent, without significant profile changes, over a rest-frame baseline of $\\sim 15$ yrs in J1025 and J1047, respectively. The three LRDs stand out in the Balmer line properties compared with normal broad-line AGNs, with exceptionally large H$α$ equivalent widths and H$α$/H$β$ ratios far exceeding the Case B recombination value. In the context of recent theoretical models of LRDs as dense gas-enshrouded massive black holes with super-Eddington accretion, our results suggest that the photosphere emission is long-term stable and the broad Balmer lines are primarily collisonally excited. This scenario is consistent with the lack of variability, large H$α$/H$β$ ratios and little dust extinction, as well as the expected high gas density. Virial black hole mass estimates using broad H$α$ assuming photoionization are therefore highly questionable for LRDs."}

Accepted for publication in ApJ", "summary": "JWST/NIRCam observations reveal dense stellar cores in high-redshift galactic bulges, indicative of sustained star formation and potential stellar accretion. We introduce accretion-modified star (AMS) as a new component in the chemical evolution of high-redshift bulges hosting active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The gas-phase chemical evolution of bulge environments containing AMS is modeled within 1 Gyr by combining population evolution and galactic chemical evolution formalisms, and observational signatures are tracked via photoionization modeling on Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagrams. Sustained high accretion onto AMSs leads to rapid gas-phase metal enrichment of the bulge, producing abundance peaks up to five times solar metallicity within 0.1 Gyr and significantly modifying elemental ratios in the gas phase. Atypical gas-phase abundance patterns during early, high-accretion phases and gradually diminish as the accretion rate declines. In BPT diagrams, high-AMS-accretion scenarios shift the modeled emission-line sequence toward the local AGN branch and extend into the high-metallicity regime. Super-solar narrow-line regions observed in AGNs at z>15 may reflect such AMS-driven gas-phase enrichment of host bulge under extreme gas densities. While direct detection of AMSs within AGN bulges remains challenging, the model provides testable predictions for future spectroscopic surveys and motivates further exploration of non-canonical stellar populations in AGN host bulges."}

We detect a mass-dependent environmental offset: massive protocluster galaxies are metal-poor compared to field counterparts of similar mass, whereas lower-mass systems exhibit comparable or mildly enhanced metallicities. This trend is consistent with a scenario where cold-mode accretion dilutes the interstellar medium (ISM) across the full mass range, while efficient recycling of feedback-driven outflows preferentially enriches the ISM in low-mass galaxies. Finally, we assess the dependence of metallicity offsets on local overdensity and find no significant trend, likely reflecting the survey's bias toward protocluster cores."}

In this work, we clarify and reconfirm this result with DESI DR2 and the latest ACT DR6 and SPT-3G D1, the tightest small-scale CMB constraints up to date. In the $w_0w_a$CDM model with EDE, a quintessence-like component ($w_0+w_a\\geq-1$) can be 1$σ$ consistent with Planck+ACT+SPT+DESI+Pantheon+SH0ES datasets, and $Δχ^2\\lesssim -14$ compared with $w_0w_a$CDM model without EDE.

These sources were chosen based on the presence of double peaks or asymmetries in their emission lines as observed in SDSS spectra. Parsec-scale radio emission is detected in 7 of the 8 sources in the second epoch. Jet-like features appear to persist over a $\\sim4-9$ year timeline in these `radio-quiet' AGN. A few sources like KISSR1494, however, show significantly different structures after a 9 year interval. KISSR102, which was previously suggested to be a binary black hole candidate based on the presence of two compact cores, shows the tentative signatures of superluminal jet motion ($1.05\\pm0.45$c). Tentative superluminal motion in a jet knot has been reported in another source, KISSR872 ($1.65\\pm0.57$c). We present 1.5 GHz images from the VLA A-array of 4 sources. These images reveal core-lobe or core-halo structures. The alignment of the VLBI jet direction with the kpc-scale spectral index gradient, as well as the mismatch between the star formation rate derived from the radio and H$α$ line emission, support the suggestion that the kpc-scale emission is AGN-jet-related. The jets in KISSR sources appear to lose collimation over spatial scales between 200 parsec and 1 kpc. Overall, the characteristics of the KISSR jets are reminiscent of similar properties observed in VLBI monitoring studies of `radio-loud' AGN jets even as subtle differences related to the compactness and brightness of jet features remain."}

Although iron depletion is observed in the interstellar medium (ISM), the exact form and fraction of iron in solid remains under debate. In particular, it is unclear whether amorphous silicate dust around AGB stars contains metallic iron. We aimed to provide optical constants of amorphous silicate nanoparticles and examine the effects of metallic iron on their spectral features to better constrain the dust properties by producing amorphous silicate nanoparticles with and without metallic cores. We performed condensation experiments using an induction thermal plasma system to produce dust analogues of the CI chondritic composition in the Mg-Ca-Na-Al-Si-Fe-Ni-O and Mg-Ca-Na-Al-Si-O systems. We measured the absorbance and reflectance of the samples, observed the structure of the products, and determined the optical constants. Two types of amorphous silicate nanoparticles (10-200 nm in diameter) with nearly CI chondritic composition were produced: one contained kamacite (Fe: Ni=0.9: 0.1) cores with a diameter ratio ranging 0-0.87 (average ~0.50), and the other was iron-free homogeneous amorphous silicate. The amorphous silicates of the CI chondritic composition with various sized metallic cores may be prevalent in circumstellar and interstellar dust."}

At low metallicities (Z), WN3-type WR stars have relatively thin winds and are major sources of ionizing flux. The detection of high-ionization emission lines in high-redshift ($z$) galaxies as well as nearby low-Z dwarf galaxies raises questions about the origin of He II ionizing radiation and its role in galaxy evolution, as stellar population models fail to reproduce the required fluxes. Low-Z WN3 stars may provide the missing contribution but are easily hidden in integrated light. Using the Local Volume Mapper, we compare resolved optical spectra of SMC WN3 stars with integrated regions, focusing on the broad He II $\\lambda4686\\,Å$ line. We find stellar emission diluted within nebular regions, becoming undetectable when integrating over areas larger than 24 pc.

There are conflicting claims in the literature regarding how environment influences size: both direct transformative effects and `assembly bias' may contribute to observed variations with environment. We construct a large homogeneous sample of size measurements to M*~10^7 Msun. Our sample fills a gap in field galaxy size measurements around 10^7-10^8 Msun; the literature at these masses is biased towards satellites of L* galaxies and members of galaxy clusters. We use sizes from the DESI-LS, together with a published catalog that contains stellar masses and cluster positions derived from DESI-LS photometry. Our sample extends to z<0.3 and comprises 540,228 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts and 9,513,732 galaxies with photometric redshifts. We explore the environmental dependence of size for a mass-limited subset of our sample at z<0.05, based on distance to the nearest cluster center. We obtain size-luminosity and size-mass relations in good agreement with previous studies. By separating galaxies according to color and morphology, we show that the environmental variation of the overall size-mass relation on Mpc scales can be understood as the consequence of a changing mixture of subpopulations, rather than direct size transformation. For example, at fixed mass, quiescent (red) late-type galaxies within 2Mpc of a cluster have the same size as quiescent late-type galaxies 30Mpc from the nearest cluster. Our results support individual galaxy assembly histories as the primary determinant of galaxy size. The existence of significantly different, environment-insensitive size mass relations for subpopulations separated by color and Sersic index provides a clear target for calibration of the baryon cycle in cosmological simulations."}

Mergers and collisions between dwarf galaxies and dark matter subhaloes (DMSHs) play an important role in the evolution and formation of structures within a massive galaxy. We investigate the collision frequency between DMSHs associated with a massive host galaxy such as the Milky Way. We analytically estimate the density distribution of DMSH pairs for the relative distance and relative velocity ($r_\\mathrm{rel}$-$v_\\mathrm{rel}$) and the distance from the centre of the host halo and relative velocity ($r$-$v_\\mathrm{rel}$) planes, based on the distribution function of the host halo in the phase space. Then, we evaluate the collision frequencies of DMSHs by integrating the orbital evolution of DMSHs in Milky-Way-like host haloes selected from cosmological $N$-body simulations. The frequency of violent encounters, in which the relative distance of DMSHs is shorter than the sum of scale radii, is averaged as $2.1\\times 10^2\\,\\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}$. Since the time scale of violent encounters, $4.7\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$, is shorter than the dynamical time of the host halo, collisions between DMSHs occur frequently within the host halo. Although interactions between DMSHs produce pairs with higher relative velocities, the density distributions of all and colliding pairs between DMSHs provided by numerical results are approximately similar to those of the analytical model neglecting the interactions of DMSHs on $r_\\mathrm{rel}$-$v_\\mathrm{rel}$ plane for all pairs and $r$-$v_\\mathrm{rel}$ plane for colliding pairs.

Studying its properties and the correlations with the physical parameters (e.g. black hole mass and accretion rate) provides significant insights into accretion physics. However, the detailed picture and the exact interplay between different emitting regions are not yet clear. We combine data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System 1 (Pan-STARRS1, PS1), the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), and the Gaia space telescope to constrain the power spectrum of quasars in the Stripe-82 region over a broad frequency range, 10^{-1} to 10^{-3} day^{-1}(rest frame). Light curves are matched and cross-calibrated to reach \\sim 20 years in the r-band for 4037 quasars. We split the sample into bins of the same black hole mass, accretion rate, and redshift, and measure the ensemble power spectral density (PSD) in each bin. The power spectra of SDSS, ZTF, and Gaia are measured independently. We do not measure it on PS1 data due to more erratic cadence, but we discuss the use of interpolation techniques, eventually allowing us to use the data together. We find significant evidence that the long-term UV/optical variability of quasars is stationary, as the ensemble PSD estimates from SDSS, Gaia and ZTF are consistent within the errors despite coming from different surveys and years. The PSD shape is consistent with a bending power law with spectral indices of -2.7 and -1 at high and low frequencies. A fit with the PSD associated with a damped random walk is significantly worse. The PSD amplitude below the break does not depend on black hole mass, but there is some evidence for anti-correlation with the accretion rate. The bending frequency, instead, scales with the black hole mass as $ν_b$ \\propto M_{\\mathrm{BH}}^{-0.6\\pm0.1} and does not depend on the accretion rate."}
