A key challenge lies in recovering the faint HI signal from bright foregrounds and frequency-dependent beam effects, which can compromise traditional cleaning methods like principal component analysis (PCA) by removing part of the cosmological signal. Deep-learning approaches have recently been proposed to mitigate these effects by learning mappings between contaminated and true cosmological signals. Building upon our previous work~\\citep{2024PhRvD.109f3509S} on the frequency-differencing (FD) method, this study extends the framework to systematically compare FD-based and PCA-based UNet reconstructions using realistic simulations that include foregrounds and beam convolution. We find that both approaches perform comparably without beam or with a Gaussian beam, but under a realistic cosine beam they systematically underestimate the large-scale cross-correlation power spectrum, particularly for $k<0.1 h~\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. To address this limitation, we explore a hybrid approach in which the UNet is trained with two input channels, one constructed from FD and the other from PCA cleaning, allowing the network to simultaneously exploit the strengths of both inputs. This two-channel strategy achieves superior performance, maintaining the cross-correlation power spectrum close to unity on large scales under a cosine beam, improving by 5-8% relative to either FD-based or PCA-based UNet alone. These results demonstrate that providing complementary FD and PCA information to a single deep network is an effective route to robust HI reconstruction, laying the groundwork for precision BAO measurements with future low-redshift 21 cm IM surveys."}

In most studies, dark energy is considered a single dynamic component. In fact, multi-component dark energy models may theoretically explain the accelerated expansion of the universe as well. In our previous research, we constructed the $w_{\\rm{n}}$CDM ($n=2, 3, 5$) models and conducted numerical research, finding strong observational support when the value of n is small. Based on our results, both the $χ^2$ and Akaike information criterion (AIC) favor the $w_{\\rm{2}}$CDM model more than the $w_0w_{\\rm{a}}$CDM model. However, previous studies were limited to two equal-component dark energy models, failing to consider the component proportions as variables. Therefore, we will further explore the $w_{\\rm{2}}$CDM model. To simplify the model, we fix $w = -1$ in one component and set the other component to $w_{\\rm{de2}}$, varying the proportions of both components in the population. Under different $w_{\\rm{de2}}$, we obtain the one-dimensional distribution of ${H}_{0}$ with respect to $f_{\\rm{de2}}$. Further fitting reveals the evolution of ${H}_{0}$ under varying $w_{\\rm{de2}}$ and $f_{\\rm{de2}}$. We also perform the same operation on $χ^2$. To evaluate the error of fitting, we introduce two indicators, $\\text{R}^{2}_{\\text{adj}}$ and MAPE, to quantify the fitting ability of our models. We find that when $w_{\\rm{de2}}$ is less than -1, ${H}_{0}$ increases with the decrease of $w_{\\rm{de2}}$ and the increase of $f_{\\rm{de2}}$, effectively alleviating ${H}_{0}$ tension. For $χ^2$, it still prefers the $Λ$CDM model, and the $w_{\\rm{2}}$CDM model will decrease significantly when it approaches the $Λ$CDM model. The excellent performance of $\\text{R}^{2}_{\\text{adj}}$ and MAPE further proves that our model has an outstanding fitting effect and extremely high reliability."}

Reactions with slow nuclei and the overall effect", "comment": null, "summary": "The present paper completes a series of our works on non-thermal nuclear processes in big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) started in JCAP05(2008)010 (Part I) and 05(2009)001 (Part II). The processes are triggered by non-Maxwellian particles naturally born in the main BBN reactions. Half of these reactions generate fast particles k^+ (= n,p,t,3He,alpha). The other half, being radiative capture processes, produce slow nuclei k^- (= d,t,3He,7Li,7Be) which can undergo (k^-,n) reactions with neutrons having large cross sections. The particle production rate R_k, thermalization time tau_k, and effective number density n_k are determined. It is shown that the values of n_k at the Universe temperatures T > 65 keV can exceed the number densities of Maxwellian 7Li and 7Be ions. To clarify the overall non-Maxwellian effect on BBN, both types of the non-Maxwellian particles are taken into account in the reaction network. Particular attention is paid to two-step sequential processes like p(n,gamma)d^-(n,gamma)t, d(p,gamma)3He^-(n,p)t, t(alpha,gamma)7Li^-(n,gamma)8Li, 3He(alpha,gamma)7Be^-(n,p)7Li, d(t,alpha)n^+(A,n)a_1a_2, and d(3He,alpha)p^+(A,p)a_1a_2 with (A,a_1,a_2) = 7Li,t,alpha) and (7Be,3He,alpha. It is obtained that the non-Maxwellian particles can selectively affect the element abundances, e.g., improve the prediction on 7Li/H by ~1.5% and at the same time leave unchanged the 4He abundance. The main conclusion however is that these particles are unable to significantly change the standard picture of BBN in general, and provide a pathway toward a solution of the cosmological lithium problem in particular."}

Its essential tenet is the modification of the gravity law at low accelerations. Nevertheless, despite MOND's passed tests, the puzzle of the missing mass on galaxy clusters' scales still persists. One proposed scenario to complete this deficit and apply it further to cosmology is the so-called $ν$HDM model. It is composed of a sterile neutrino and the MOND gravity. In this Ph.D. thesis, I have put forward this cosmological idea, conducting hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the $ν$HDM structure formation. In the debut attempt, the $ν$HDM model was proven capable of reproducing the $Λ$CDM cosmology, imitating the same expansion history ($Ω_m \\approx$ 0.3 and $H_0 \\approx$ 67.6 km/s/Mpc), reproducing the CMB phenomenology, while the cosmic web is nicely formed. In the next step, I have optimized the $ν$HDM model using Bayesian statistics, re-branding it to opt-$ν$HDM. I managed to optimally fit the angular power spectrum of the CMB calculated by \\textit{Planck}, except its fourth peak, but the opt-$ν$HDM cosmological parameters changed significantly with respect to its precursor, resulting in a much heavier cosmos, with $Ω_m \\approx$ 0.5 and $H_0 \\approx$ 55.6 km/s/Mpc. Next, I explore the opt-$ν$HDM expansion history, its structure formation and the resulting mass function. The appearance of the early-time structures, firstly in the $ν$HDM model, as well as in the opt-$ν$HDM model occurs quiet late, at $z\\approx4$ and at $z\\approx 5.5$, respectively. Although the resolution has improved from previous studies, the $ν$HDM variants cannot explain easily the high-redshift galaxies, observed by JWST."}

Using PHANGS-JWST and PHANGS-ALMA data, we identify localized regions where this correlation fails, with CO flux exceeding that predicted from 7.7$μ$m PAH emission by more than an order of magnitude. These outlier regions are found in 20 out of 70 galaxies and are mostly located in galaxy centers and bars, without signs of massive star formation. We explore two scenarios to explain the elevated CO-to-PAH ratios, which can either be due to suppressed PAH emission or enhanced CO emissivity. We examine PAH emission in other bands (3.3$μ$m and 11.3$μ$m) and the dust continuum dominated bands (10$μ$m and 21$μ$m), finding consistently high CO-to-PAH (or CO-to-dust continuum) emission ratios, suggesting that 7.7$μ$m PAH emission is not particularly suppressed. In some outlier regions, PAH size distributions and spectral energy distribution of the illuminating radiation differ slightly compared to nearby control regions with normal CO-to-PAH ratios, though without a consistent trend. We find that the outlier regions generally show higher CO velocity dispersions ($Δv_{\\mathrm{CO}}$). This increase in $Δv_{\\mathrm{CO}}$ may lower CO optical depth and raise its emissivity for a given gas mass. Our results favor a scenario where shear along the bar lanes and shocks at the tips of the bar elevate CO emissivity, leading to the breakdown of the CO-PAH correlation."}

Our method, which relies exclusively on comparing successive range intervals measured by independent local clocks, was applied to data from the GRACE-FO mission. We observe a coherent signal in the derivative of the relative velocity projection, (v_A-v_B) dot V, that exhibits a clear orbital-period modulation. Crucially, the phase and amplitude of this modulation are found to be in excellent agreement across four distinct seasonal datasets, providing strong evidence against a purely random origin.\n  Expressing this observable within the Standard-Model Extension (SME) framework yields an effective velocity magnitude of |V| ~= 139.3 +/- 0.1 km/s. While the corresponding effective SME coefficients (s-bar^0j from 10^-5 to 10^-4) exceed current laboratory bounds, the signal's stability and its coherence with the orbital frame make it a valuable diagnostic for systematic effects in orbital ranging. This work constitutes the first synchronization-free detection of a stable, orbital-scale signal of this type and establishes a clear, experimental path forward: applying this method to other platforms, most critically GNSS, to determine if the signal is a mission-specific systematic or a universal physical effect."}

Using the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2, we identify galaxy multiplets as discrete objects and measure their cross-correlations with the general galaxy field. Our results show that the multiplets exhibit stronger clustering bias as they trace more massive dark matter halos than individual galaxies. When comparing the observed clustering statistics with the mock catalogs generated from the N-body simulation AbacusSummit, we find that the mocks underpredict multiplet clustering despite reproducing the galaxy two-point auto-correlation reasonably well. This discrepancy indicates that the standard Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model is insufficient to describe the properties of galaxy multiplets, revealing the greater constraining power of this higher-order statistic on galaxy-halo connection and the possibility that multiplets are specific to additional assembly bias. We demonstrate that incorporating secondary biases into the HOD model improves agreement with the observed multiplet statistics, specifically by allowing galaxies to preferentially occupy halos in denser environments. Our results highlight the potential of utilizing multiplet clustering, beyond traditional two-point correlation measurements, to break degeneracies in models describing the galaxy-dark matter connection."}

The hot, shocked phase of these outflows ($T \\gtrsim 10^{6} \\rm{\\ K}$) is expected to dominate the energy content, but is challenging to observe due to its long cooling time and low emissivity. The cool phase ($T \\lesssim 10^{4} \\rm{\\ K}$) is easier to detect observationally, but it traces a less energetic outflow component. In prior simulations of the interaction between an energy-driven AGN outflow and a clumpy ISM, we found that mixing between hot wind and cool ISM clouds produces a new, highly radiative, phase at $T \\approx 10^{6-7} \\rm{\\ K}$ which fuels the formation of a long-lived ($\\geq 5\\ \\rm{Myr}$) cool outflow. We investigate the X-ray emission generated by thermal Bremsstrahlung and high-ionisation metal line emission in this mixing phase, finding that it could contribute significantly to the X-ray output of the outflow. This mixing-induced X-ray emission is strongest in the part of the outflow propagating equatorially through the disc, and is extended on scales of $D\\simeq 3-4\\ \\rm{kpc}$.

D 34, 2550052 (2025), arXiv:2508.00035], we introduced a PT-symmetric wormhole model based on a bimetric geometry, capable of generating closed timelike curves (CTCs). In this paper, we extend the analysis to the null hypersurface at the throat of this modified Einstein-Rosen bridge, where two regular Eddington-Finkelstein metrics render the geometry traversable. Using the Barrabes--Israel formalism in Poisson's reformulation, we evaluate the null shell's surface stress-energy tensor $S^{αβ}$ from the jump of the transverse curvature, revealing a violation of the null energy condition: a lightlike membrane of exotic matter with negative surface energy density and positive tangential pressure. This exotic fluid acts as a repulsive source stabilizing the throat, ensuring consistency with the Einstein field equations, including conservation laws on the shell. Beyond the local characterization, we outline potential observational signatures: (i) gravitational-wave echoes from the photon-sphere cavity; (ii) horizon-scale imaging with duplicated and through-throat photon rings, and non-Kerr asymmetries; (iii) quantum effects such as PT-induced frequency pairing with possible QNM doublets and partial suppression of vacuum flux at the throat; and (iv) a relic cosmological population yielding an effective $Λ_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and seeding voids. Compared with timelike thin-shell constructions, our approach is based on a null junction interpreted as a lightlike membrane, combined with PT symmetry, providing a distinct route to traversability and clarifying the conditions under which CTCs can arise in a self-consistent framework."}

Dwarf AGN hosts do not show strong differences in their distances to nodes, filaments and massive galaxies compared to the controls, which indicates that AGN triggering, at least in this sample, is not strongly correlated with environment. Finally, by combining the true number of galaxies, the detectability of AGN and the measured numbers of variable sources in dwarf and massive (M > 10^10 MSun) galaxies, we estimate the relative frequency of AGN in these two mass regimes.

It is a story of false starts, perseverance, and remarkable insights, propelled as much by technological progress as by human curiosity. We now proudly live in the new golden age of gravitational physics. The detection of gravitational wave signals from the merger of binary black holes and neutron stars are becoming routine. Coupled with our theoretical understanding of phenomena in the strong gravity regime, black hole physics has become a precision science. The purpose of these lecture notes is to help the reader understand the language and framework of this rapidly evolving subject, and to develop the ability to interpret, think, and discuss ideas that lie at the confluence of gravitational wave astronomy and black hole physics. It is our hope that these notes will prepare students and colleagues for the next revolution when gravitational wave events become commonplace and we begin to observe unexpected features in the signal, indicating either surprising astrophysical scenarios or a strong need to modify the theoretical description of gravitational interactions. We provide first principles analysis of black hole and gravitational wave physics, and sometimes a very personal interpretation of results. We share with the readers a number of notebooks that will allow them to reproduce some of the most important results in the field, and could even help in carrying out state-of-the-art research.

Our goal in particular is to clarify whether near-future radio telescopes such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionisation Array (HERA), will be able to distinguish between free-streaming dark matter, specifically in the form of thermal warm DM (WDM), and collisional damping due to neutrino-DM ($ν$DM) interactions giving rise to larger overdensities on small scales. For that purpose we first implement a mapping between the two models in terms of a cutoff scale and determine detection thresholds for the two DM models. Using Fisher matrix forecasts, we show that $ν$DM interaction strengths down to $σ_{ν{\\rm DM}}\\sim 3\\times10^{-35}$ cm$^2$ could be probed by $21\\,$cm cosmology when considering two populations of galaxies for a GeV mass DM. This would allow to either confirm or rule out a recent claimed preference for a non-zero $ν$DM interaction in Lyman-$α$ data.

This transformation is identifiable by observing galaxy colors and can be seen in the morphological transformation of late-type galaxies into early-type galaxies, which creates the morphology-density relation seen when comparing populations in clusters to co-eval field galaxies. However, high-z (z > 2) galaxy morphology studies are hindered by the high angular resolution necessary to characterize morphology. We present a study of HST WFC3 F160W observations of protoclusters from the MAMMOTH survey (BOSS1244 and BOSS1542) at z ~ 2.23 with populations of previously identified HAEs. By measuring the Sersic index of 151 HAEs, we look for the early morphological transformation of star-forming galaxies in these well-studied, large, non-virialized protoclusters, which we believe are precursors of present-day clusters. We find the morphology of the populations of star-forming protocluster galaxies does not differ from the co-eval field. However, we identify a population of clumpy, potentially merging galaxies, which could lead to an increase in the population of early-type galaxies in these structures. Additionally, in BOSS1244, which has two previously identified massive quiescent galaxies including a BCG, we find an abundance of early-type galaxies near both the BCG and two co-eval high-z quasars. Although we find a strong similarity between the morphology of field and protocluster galaxies, the population of early-type star-forming galaxies surrounding the spectroscopically confirmed quiescent BCG in BOSS1244, something not seen in BOSS1542, may point to differences in the evolutionary state of these co-eval protoclusters and be a sign of an early forming cluster core in BOSS1244."}

In this way, we establish a direct mapping between the GUP parameters and the higher-order curvature coefficients in the gravitational Lagrangian. As an illustrative application, we compute corrections to the general relativistic prediction for light deflection, which in turn allows us to infer a stringent upper bound on the minimal measurable length. Our results show that GUP-induced effects can be consistently embedded into extended gravity theories, offering a promising framework for testing quantum gravity phenomenology through astrophysical and cosmological observations."}

These scenarios appear alternative dark energy parameterizations with respect to the well-known $ω_0ω_a$CDM model, claimed as the most viable model by DESI. Accordingly, we perform Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) analyses with the publicly available \\texttt{CLASS} Boltzmann code, including the three Padé cosmology, along with the $ω_0ω_a$CDM and $Λ$CDM standard pictures. To this end, we combine independent probes from high to low redshifts to obtain reliable constraints on the cosmological parameters of these models and compare them using statistical selection criteria. \\emph{Our results show that Padé cosmology is neither statistically excluded nor worse than the $ω_0ω_a$CDM parametrization}.

Key innovations of J-HERTz include Bayesian neural network classifications for 390,000 galaxies, 31,000 quasars, and 20,000 stars, along with significantly improved photometric redshifts for 235,000 galaxies compared to previous J-PLUS DR3 and LoTSS DR2 estimates. We identify 831 candidate Galactic radio stars, which, if confirmed, would constitute a significant addition to the number of radio-emitting stars identified to date. Among radio-loud galaxies with spectroscopic observations, $\\gtrsim$20% lack Seyfert or LINER signatures, indicating a substantial population of optically quiescent radio galaxies, in agreement with previous works. Spectral energy distribution fitting of their host galaxies using J-PLUS photospectra reveals systematically low specific star formation rates, consistent with quenched stellar populations. J-HERTz thus provides a powerful dataset to exploit radio-optical synergies, enabling studies that span from the origin of stellar radio emission to the AGN life cycle and the role of jet activity in shaping host galaxy evolution."}

Considering $u$ as the time coordinate, we can evolve either $R$ or $G$, with the other one found by solving the Raychaudhuri equation along the null generators, or we can evolve both. This choice of formulation is independent from the remaining gauge choice $x\\to x'(u,x,...)$ in the line element above, which is fixed incrementally by the choice of $B$. For example, we can evolve $G$, in order to be able to evolve through an event horizon, and use $B$ in to adapt the coordinates to type-II critical collapse. As a demonstration of these ideas, we consider a charged scalar field in spherical symmetry. We consider two settings: a domain where the outgoing null cones of constant $u$ emanate from a regular centre $R=0$, and a domain where the outgoing null cones emanating from an ingoing-null boundary. We demonstrate convergence with resolution, within each formulation and between the three formulations in both settings. As testbeds, we compute the critical exponents and periodic fine-structures of the black hole charge and mass scaling laws in a one-parameter family of charged regular initial data, and examples of perturbed extremal Reissner-Nordström solutions."}

To measure the MIR extinction, we employ two approaches: modeling the intrinsic-to-observed dust thermal spectrum and assessing the differential extinction between hydrogen recombination lines. Expanding on prior work, we directly model the dust-opacity distribution along the line of sight, and we make available a Python code that provides a flexible tool for deriving intrinsic dust emission spectra. We confirm the spatial variability of extinction across the field, demonstrating that dusty sources--such as IRS~29N--exhibit higher local extinction. Furthermore, we verify the absence of PAH emission features in the Galactic center MIR spectra. Using the two complementary methods, we derive a refined ``best guess'' MIR extinction law for Sgr A* and the surrounding Galactic-center region.

The stellar complex IRS 13E, a co-moving conglomerate of young and massive stars, is a prime location to study because it has been speculated to be bound by an IMBH. Assuming a standard radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) and a minimum fractional variability of 10% of intrinsic luminosity, the wavelength of peak emission in the spectral energy distribution for an IMBH would lie in the mid-infrared ($\\sim$ 5-25 $μ$m), and variability would be detectable in MIRI time-series observations. Monitoring fails to detect such variable emission (other than from Sgr A*) in and around the IRS 13E complex, and upper limits on a putative IMBH's intrinsic variability on timescales of minutes to about 1 hour are $\\lesssim$1 mJy at 12 $μ$m and $\\lesssim$2 mJy at 19 $μ$m. These translate to luminosities $\\lesssim 25 \\times 10^{32}$ erg/s. The resulting limits on the IMBH mass and accretion rate rule out any IMBH with mass $\\gtrsim 10^3$ M$_\\odot$ accreting at $\\gtrsim 10^{-6}$ times Eddington rate at the location of IRS 13E. Further, the observations rule out an IMBH anywhere in the central 6\" $\\times$ 6\" region that is more massive than $\\approx$ 2 $\\times 10^3$ M$_\\odot$ and accreting at $\\gtrsim 10^{-6}$ of the Eddington rate. Assuming Bondi accretion scaled to typical RIAF-accretion efficiencies, albeit somewhat uncertain, also allows us to rule out IMBHs moving with typical velocities of about 200 km/s and masses $\\gtrsim 2 \\times 10^3$ M$_\\odot$. These methods showcase the effectiveness of photometric variability measurements in constraining the presence of accreting black holes in Galactic centre-like environments."}

Numerical simulations have shown that dynamical friction ceases to operate in cores of (roughly) constant density, a phenomenon known as core stalling. In addition, such cores often are unstable to a dipole instability that gives rise to dynamical buoyancy, causing massive central objects to move outward. Thus far, these manifestations of core dynamics have only been demonstrated in collisionless systems. In this paper, we use idealized N-body simulations to study whether core stalling and dynamical buoyancy operate in SIDM halos. We find that if the self-interactions are sufficiently strong, neither core stalling nor buoyancy are present, and a massive perturber will quickly sink all the way to the center of its host. In doing so, it gravitationally contracts the core, catalyzing a strongly accelerated core collapse. The reason why core dynamics are so different in SIDM halos is that self-interactions drive the halo's distribution function to a featureless exponential, removing any inflections or plateaus that are responsible for the dipole instability and core stalling in the case of CDM. We discuss implications of our finding for constraining the nature of dark matter by using observations of massive objects such as supermassive black holes (SMBHs), globular clusters, and nuclear star clusters in the central regions of galaxies."}

Significant Galactic dynamic interactions can leave imprints on the orbital properties of OCs, allowing us to use the present day properties of long-lived OCs to reconstruct the MW's dynamic history. To explore these changes, we identify OC analogs in FIRE-2 simulations of MW-mass galaxies. For this work, we focus on one particular FIRE-2 OC, which we identify as an analog to the old, subsolar, distant, and high Galactic latitude MW OC, Berkeley 20. Our simulated OC resides ~6 kpc from the galactic center and ultimately reaches a height $|Z_{\\mathrm{max}}|>2$ kpc from the galactic disk, similar to Berkeley 20. We trace the simulated cluster's orbital and environmental history, identifying key perturbative episodes, including: (1) an interaction with a gas overdensity in a spiral arm that prompts an outward migration event and (2) a substantial interaction with a Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy-mass satellite that causes significant orbital modification. Our simulated OC shows significant resilience to disruption during both its outward migration and the satellite-driven heating event that causes subsequent inward migration.

The thermal backreaction is incorporated through a dissipation coefficient that depends linearly on the temperature, and the model parameters are chosen to remain consistent with Planck observational constraints. By numerically integrating the complete set of three coupled, nonlinear differential equations that describe the evolution of the inflaton field, radiation energy density, and background expansion, we obtain an exact description of the system's dynamics.

While this holds in a static, axisymmetric potential, it is unknown how strongly the time-varying, non-axisymmetric structure of a real galactic disk drives action drift that inhibits cluster reconstruction. We answer this question using a high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a Milky Way-like spiral disc galaxy. We show that, while stars experience significant action evolution over $\\lesssim 100$ Myr, they do so in a correlated fashion whereby stars born in close proximity maintain very similar actions for up to 0.5 Gyr. The degree of coherence shows no significant dependence on galactocentric radius, but varies between action components: vertical actions decohere for stars born more than a few hundred parsecs apart (likely due to giant molecular clouds), while radial and azimuthal actions remain correlated on kiloparsec scales (likely influenced by spiral arms). We use our measurements of the rate of action decoherence to develop a probabilistic framework that lets us infer the initial sizes of the star cluster progenitors of present-day stellar streams from their measured action distributions, which we apply to 438 known moving groups. Our results suggest that most of these streams likely originated from compact clusters, but that a significant minority are instead likely to be resonant or dynamically induced structures. This method of classifying streams complements existing methods, optimises the use of expensive spectroscopic abundance measurements, and will be enhanced by the more precise kinematic data that will soon become available from \\textit{Gaia} DR4."}

(2025), we investigate the evolutionary sequence of broad emission lines using a redshift-selected subset (0.35 < z < 0.45) of 54 CL-AGNs whose Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) spectra simultaneously cover the Hα, H\\b{eta}, and Mg II emission lines. To provide a baseline for comparison, we construct a control sample of 19,897 normal Type 1 AGNs within the same redshift range from the DESI Year 1 data. Through stacked spectral analysis and line-continuum luminosity correlations, we identify a clear evolutionary sequence in all AGN where broad H\\b{eta} fades first, followed by Mg II, and then Hα, as the AGN luminosity declines - consistent with expectations from reverberation mapping. This trend reflects a radially stratified broad line region (BLR), where each line's responsivity depends on its ionization potential and radial distance from the central engine. In addition, we find that more massive supermassive black holes (SMBHs) require lower Eddington ratios to fully suppress broad emission lines, suggesting that the critical accretion threshold for the CL phenomenon is mass-dependent. Our results present the first statistical confirmation of a stratified broad line fading sequence in AGNs, reinforcing the central role of accretion state in shaping BLR structure and visibility."}

A previous study of HH 111 VLA1 suggested a decrease in rotation velocity in a region between the infalling envelope and rotating disk. Using ALMA C$^{18}$O ($J = 2-1$) data, we analyzed the gas motion within 6000 au and found clear deviations from the simplest expectations of free-fall towards the central star with conserved angular momentum in the transition region between the envelope and disk (from $\\sim$5200 to 160 au). The region can be further divided into three zones: (1) outer region with a significant decrease in infall velocity, dropping to approximately 60\\% of the free-fall velocity and 70\\% of conservation of angular momentum and energy; (2) middle region with a sharp drop in angular momentum and thus rotation velocity and an increase in infall velocity; and (3) inner region with rotation velocity increasing inward to connect to that of the Keplerian disk and infall velocity decreasing to zero. Comparison with non-ideal MHD simulations suggests that the reduced infall velocity in the outer region can be due to magnetic tension by the pinched magnetic field lines, the sharp drop of angular momentum in the middle region can be due to magnetic braking as the field lines pile up, and the rapid increase in rotation velocity in the inner region might result from weaker magnetic braking due to ambipolar diffusion of the field lines. The resulting dip in the rotation profile supports magnetic braking."}

In this work we revisit this problem by relying on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as flexible partial differential equations solvers thereby providing a comparative assessment of several recent neural architectures. Building on the Einstein-massless-Klein-Gordon formulation in polar-areal coordinates, we consider four initial-value problems encompassing subcritical, critical, and supercritical regimes and use high-resolution finite-difference simulations as reference solutions. Our study is primarily comparative: we evaluate several state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including vanilla and high-precision PINNs, sinusoidal-feature and quadratic-residual variants, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, all trained under a common loss design that encodes the field equations, boundary conditions, and causal time-space enforcement, together with a novel adaptive spacetime sampling. Within this framework we also introduce ModPINN, a modest modification of standard PINNs that augments standard multiplayer perceptrons with coordinate embeddings, quadratic layers among other common ingredients in recent literature. This study shows that deep-learning-based methods can reproduce finite-difference solutions for the scalar field and the spacetime metric with competitive accuracy using significantly fewer collocation points than more traditional methodologies. While no single architecture dominates in all regimes, ModPINN achieves particularly stable and accurate solutions near criticality, indicating that suitable designed embeddings and adaptive sampling can enhance the robustness of PINNs for challenging gravitational-collapse scenarios."}

We identify 97 CL quasars showing significant variability in high-ionization broad emission lines, including 45 turn-on and 52 turn-off events, corresponding to a detection rate of approximately 0.042%. This rate is lower than that found for low-ionization CL quasars, likely due to both selection effects and physical differences in high-ionization lines. Based on the CL quasar sample, we find that CL quasars generally exhibit lower accretion rates compared to typical quasars, with average Eddington ratios of log lambda_Edd approximately -1.14 in the bright state and approximately -1.39 in the dim state, compared to approximately -0.65 for typical quasars. While high-ionization lines in CL quasars follow the Baldwin effect on a population level, some individual sources show inverse Baldwin trends. We also find a positive correlation between the variability of high-ionization lines such as Mg II and C III] and the change in bolometric luminosity. In addition, we estimate a characteristic rest-frame timescale of approximately 3 years for CL transitions, with no significant difference between turn-on and turn-off cases. Taken together, these results support an accretion-driven origin for the CL phenomenon and provide new insights into the variability of high-ionization emission lines."}

We develop a covariant framework for open quantum dynamics along arbitrary timelike worldlines by building multi-time quantum processes (process tensors) from overlapping causal diamonds. For an Unruh--DeWitt detector weakly coupled to a scalar field in a Hadamard state, we define a foliation-independent measure of non-Markovianity as the operational distance between the physical process tensor and the convex set of Markovian (CP-divisible) processes. Numerical benchmarks in $(1{+}1)$ dimensions compare inertial motion, uniform acceleration, and static and infalling trajectories in Schwarzschild spacetime. Inertial trajectories are found to be almost Markovian, whereas acceleration and curvature generate pronounced long-range temporal correlations and strong non-Markovian behaviour. In Rindler spacetime, acceleration produces horizon-induced memory tails. In Schwarzschild spacetime, near-horizon field correlations cause both static and freely falling observers to experience enhanced memory, which can remain hidden in single-step diagnostics but becomes evident in multi-time protocols and can even be superactivated by combining different time steps. Our results provide, to our knowledge, the first coordinate-independent, operational quantification of quantum memory in relativistic settings. They identify spacetime curvature, horizons, and acceleration as controllable ingredients that can either degrade or be harnessed as resources in relativistic quantum information tasks, including communication and metrology with accelerated detectors and near black holes."}

This picture is motivated by analytical and semi-analytical models in which momentum-driven AGN winds can expel the gas once the SMBH reaches a critical mass. However, these models typically assume idealised conditions: smooth gas distributions, spherical symmetry, and very efficient cooling of the shocked AGN wind.\n  We checked whether AGN outflows can establish the $M-σ$ relation in a multi-phase and turbulent galactic bulge subject to realistic radiative cooling while conserving the shocked AGN wind energy.\n  We calculated a suite of purpose-built hydrodynamical simulations of AGN outflows in turbulent gas shells, covering a wide range of constant AGN luminosities. We tracked the outflow evolution over the course of $\\geq1$~Myr. We analysed the effect of AGN outflow on the cold dense gas and SMBH feeding, estimating the luminosity threshold for removing most of the cold gas from the central regions.\n  We find that AGNs with significantly sub-Eddington luminosities cannot suppress SMBH feeding, while luminosities exceeding $\\sim 0.7$ times Eddington clear out both the diffuse hot gas and the cold clumps, consistent with the momentum-driven outflow formalism. We also show that dense gas clusters are affected almost exclusively by the AGN wind momentum, while the shocked wind energy escapes through low-density channels and inflates large bubbles of diffuse gas. Therefore, AGN wind-driven energy-conserving feedback in a turbulent multi-phase medium affects the dense gas only via the wind momentum. Thus, the momentum-driven outflow paradigm is applicable for explaining the $M-σ$ relation even in realistic systems."}

This critique has prompted an ongoing debate over how to distinguish substantive general covariance from mere formal general covariance. Some proposals for defining substantive general covariance are based on the requirement that a theory be derivable from a diffeomorphism-invariant action. The present work aims to critically assess these proposals by examining canonical examples of Kretschmannian formulations of special relativistic theories. It will be shown that these formulations -- which seem merely formally generally covariant -- can always be derived from a diffeomorphism-invariant action. Although these actions involve auxiliary variables, these variables are trivial in the sense that they are either pure gauge or dynamically fixed by the other variables. Consequently, the theories described by these actions are arguably equivalent to the original Kretschmannian formulations. This stands in contrast to the actions proposed by Rosen and Sorkin, which include non-trivial auxiliary variables and hence seem to describe distinct physical theories. More recently, Freidel and Teh have suggested an additional criterion for substantial general covariance, namely that the action should also yield a non-trivial corner charge associated to diffeomorphism invariance. However, this too appears insufficient, since such actions can always be constructed."}

G358.46$-$0.39 is previously known to consist of 4 dust continuum cores (MM1a, MM1b, MM1c and MM2). The integrated intensity map of C$^{17}$O reveals filamentary and dumbbell-shaped structures that are probably compressed gases from the expansion of the HII region MM2.

The spatial distribution of HC$_{3}$N and SO$_{2}$ molecules in MM1a shows a compact morphology, with no detectable HC$_{3}$N and SO$_{2}$ emissions in the other cores.

We estimated abundances using full-spectrum fitting, full-index fitting, and line-strength analysis, in combination with different stellar population models. We first tested these techniques on mock spectra and SDSS stacked spectra of ETGs, and then applied them to high-quality long-slit spectroscopy of the M31 bulge obtained with the OSIRIS spectrograph at the GTC. We find that O, N, and Na are significantly enhanced relative to Fe across the bulge, with typical abundances >0.3~dex. In particular, N and Na show steep central enhancements, reaching ~0.5dex. C, Mg, and Si exhibit intermediate enhancements of [X/Fe]~0.2dex, with C and Mg decreasing toward the center to <~0.1dex; while Ca, and to a lesser extent Ti, closely follow Fe, with [X/Fe]<0.1dex. Applying the same analysis to SDSS stacked spectra of ETGs revealed that the abundance pattern of the M31 bulge closely resembles that of the most massive galaxies, except for N, which is significantly more enhanced (by ~0.1dex) in the bulge. For the bulk of the bulge, chemical evolution models assuming high star-formation efficiency and a short gas infall timescale reproduce the overall trends in [Fe/H] and [X/Fe]. In the central region (<~100pc), the high metallicity content of the bulge can be explained by either an IMF flatter than Salpeter at high mass, or a prolonged star formation. Additional processes, such as differential galactic winds, appear necessary to account for the observed decoupling among alpha elements and the strong central N enhancement. Our results support a scenario whereby the bulk of the M31 bulge formed during a fast and intense episode of star formation."}

Its environment is challenging to explore because it is located at low Galactic latitudes, behind the Galactic disc. The long-term goal is to characterise the Circinus galaxy halo and determine the presence of dwarf satellites using near-infrared data. We selected 1,542 galaxies from the VVV NIRGC within a 2-degree radius around Circinus, representing 2/3 of the virial radius. Structural parameters such as half-light radii and colours were used, and correlations were examined. A neural network was trained with 486 galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts to estimate photometric redshifts for all galaxies. Potential satellites were defined based on half-light radii compatible with the typical sizes of dwarf satellites, and combined with photometric redshifts. The galaxy properties are reliably characterised down to $K_{s}$ $\\sim$ 15.5 mag, which represents about 90% completeness of detections. At the distance of Circinus, this limiting magnitude corresponds to $K_{s}$ absolute magnitude of $-12.6$ mag, which allows us to find dwarf galaxies. There are 20 galaxies with half-light radii larger than 2.45 arcsec, only 8 have photometric redshifts below 0.04. None of these galaxies is close to Circinus, which has a redshift of 0.0015. The ANNz model exhibited a high degree of accuracy in the range $0.001 < z_{phot} < 0.023$. The presence of dwarf satellites could not be confirmed with the available data in the studied region. The apparent lack of satellites may be genuine, possibly related to AGN feedback effects. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining near-infrared data and machine learning techniques to estimate photometric redshifts at low Galactic latitudes, providing useful information for future spectroscopic follow-up campaigns."}

Ostrowski"], "title": "Relativistic models of structure formation with stable end-state configuration", "comment": "15 pages + references, no figures", "summary": "The aim of this paper is to provide an analytical model for the formation of stable structures (cosmological or astrophysical), where stability is obtained through the tangential pressure countering the effect of gravity. We utilize the generalization of the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) spacetime to matter with tangential pressure generated by the angular momentum of fluid particles. Extending the Krasiński-Hellaby (KH) LTB reconstruction method, we show how set of three functions defined on two arbitrary hypersurfaces can fully determine the spacetime geometry. We further restrict our attention to the bounded case and develop the weak-field and the small-angular-momentum approximations. We show how these can be applied to the exact solution on the initial hypersurface, together with the oscillatory solution on the final hypersurface, to considerably simplify the reconstruction scheme. The so obtained models exhibit explicit dust-like behaviour in the early and middle stages of the collapse, and reach the final state as oscillations around the static solution."}

Mena Marugán", "Antonio Vicente-Becerril"], "title": "Starobinsky potential and power suppression in hybrid Loop Quantum Cosmology", "comment": "13 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "We study the effect on the primordial tensor power spectrum of varying the number of e-folds during slow-roll inflation in Loop Quantum Cosmology with a Starobinsky potential. Using the hybrid quantization approach, we derive the effective mass governing tensor mode evolution. The choice of vacuum state is crucial, especially since the preinflationary phase predicted by Loop Quantum Cosmology invalidates the choice of the Bunch-Davies state as the preferred vacuum. We adopt a choice which is optimally adapted to the dynamics, so that it provides a non-oscillating (NO) spectrum free of spurious contributions, and permits an asymptotic Hamiltonian diagonalization (AHD) of the perturbations. For this so-called NO-AHD vacuum, we compute the power spectrum using both analytic approximations and numerical integration. Our results confirm the accuracy of our approximations in a wide range of situations, including short- and long-lived inflationary scenarios. The primordial power spectrum exhibits a characteristic cutoff on a wavenumber scale determined primarily by the background dynamics around the bounce that replaces the big bang in Loop Quantum Cosmology."}

Dark energy is modeled as a quintessence scalar field with bulk viscosity, while dark matter is allowed to interact with the scalar sector. The displacement vector field, arising naturally in Lyra's manifold, provides an additional geometric contribution. By employing dynamical system techniques, we analyze stability properties and late-time attractors. Our results indicate that viscosity and DE--DM interaction enrich the phase space structure and can help address both the cosmic acceleration and the coincidence problem. Furthermore, by performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis with recent observational datasets, we derive best-fit values for the model parameters that exhibit good consistency with current data."}

These scenarios appear alternative dark energy parameterizations with respect to the well-known $ω_0ω_a$CDM model, claimed as the most viable model by DESI. Accordingly, we perform Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) analyses with the publicly available \\texttt{CLASS} Boltzmann code, including the three Padé cosmology, along with the $ω_0ω_a$CDM and $Λ$CDM standard pictures. To this end, we combine independent probes from high to low redshifts to obtain reliable constraints on the cosmological parameters of these models and compare them using statistical selection criteria. \\emph{Our results show that Padé cosmology is neither statistically excluded nor worse than the $ω_0ω_a$CDM parametrization}. On the contrary, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) identifies Padé$^{q}$ (0,1) as \\emph{the best-fit model}, with weak evidence against the $ω_0ω_a$CDM parameterization, while the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) provides \\emph{strong evidence against the $ω_0ω_a$CDM model, favoring Padé (1,1)}. Based on our bounds, we further investigate the evolution of the squared sound speed, revealing that the Padé$^{q}$ (0,1) and Padé$^ω$ (0,1) parameterizations exhibit enhanced stability compared with the other cases here considered and, therefore, describe robust alternatives for the cosmological background."}
