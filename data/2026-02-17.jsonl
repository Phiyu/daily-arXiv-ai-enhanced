In this work, we explore the impact of conversions between the dark and Standard Model photons in the primordial CMB spectral distortion epoch ($10^3 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 10^6$). These conversions are resonantly enhanced when the induced thermal masses of both photonic species are equal, thus leading to the possibility that sizeable distortions can be produced. To this end, we solve the Boltzmann equation at early times to determine the (irreducible) freeze-in or freeze-out abundance of dark photons. This procedure also allows us to update the limits on generic milli-charged dark sectors using the ACT DR6 bound on the number of effective radiative degrees of freedom ($N_{\\rm eff}$). By then modeling the evolution of the thermal masses in both sectors, we compute the primordial CMB distortion using the Landau-Zener formalism. We find that when the dark electron and proton are roughly similar in mass (the positronium limit), current spectral distortion data from the COBE/FIRAS instrument is able to rule out novel regions of parameter space. We also forecast bounds from the proposed FOSSIL satellite, finding that spectral distortions can also be used to probe the ultra-low dark electric charge regions of parameter space, which are difficult to investigate by other means."}

Since the cosmological 21-cm signal is measured relative to the background radiation temperature, the presence of a radio excess can significantly alter its characteristics. Previous studies have explored the impact of an inhomogeneous radio background on the global 21-cm signal and 21-cm power spectrum. This non-uniform radio background is also expected to introduce substantial non-Gaussianity. In this work, using the bispectrum, we analyze the non-Gaussianity in the 21-cm signal in the presence of an excess galactic radio background and investigate how line-of-sight radio fluctuations from early galaxies influence its nature. We find that even a moderate enhancement in radio efficiency in early galaxies significantly affects the small-scale 21-cm bispectrum. Furthermore, the delayed heating transition caused by a galactic radio background shifts the sign change in the squeezed-limit bispectrum to lower redshifts ($z\\sim11$), providing a potential observational signature for distinguishing different radio background models. These results demonstrate that the 21-cm bispectrum, particularly in the squeezed limit, is highly sensitive to radio background fluctuations, making it a powerful tool for probing high-redshift radio-loud sources and the physics of the early cosmic epoch."}

One potential signature of such a violation is cosmic birefringence - rotation of the polarization plane of photons due to Chern-Simons coupling in Maxwell's electrodynamics. This rotation angle, aka birefringence angle, depends upon the distance travelled by the photon and is thus different for CMB and 21cm photons. While the rotation angle in CMB, i.e., $α_\\mathrm{CMB}$, has been tightly constrained by CMB experiments, the potential of the 21cm cosmological signal to constrain this parameter, as well as constrain $α_\\mathrm{21cm}$, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we provide constraints on both these angles by cross-correlating 21cm and CMB signals. Using the Fisher matrix formalism, we give our forecasts for 21cm experiments, including SKA, HIRAX, and PUMA, and Planck like CMB experiment.

While gravitational effects on neutrinos are well studied in general relativity and torsion based geometries, the symmetric teleparallel regime where gravity stems solely from non-metricity, with zero curvature and torsion has remained uncharted. In this work, we perform the first analysis of neutrino oscillations in such a spacetime. Using the reduced Kerr metric in coincident gauge for the slowly rotating and weakly gravitating spherical Sun, we derive the Dirac Hamiltonian from the generalized Dirac equation and compute the accumulated phase of neutrino mass eigenstates. There are six free coupling constants in our model. Based on certain observational inputs, we inferred upper bounds on our arbitrary coupling constants. This allowed us to simplify the otherwise cumbersome calculations to some extent. Ultimately, we computed the phase differences that play a crucial role in solar neutrino oscillations and analyzed the contributions arising from our arbitrary coupling constants. Our results establish neutrino oscillations as a novel probe of non-metricity and open a new avenue for testing symmetric teleparallel gravity through astrophysical observations."}

We identify 10 new multiple-image systems in recent VENUS JWST/NIRCam imaging, so that the model is constrained with a total of 19 robust multiple-image systems -- nine of which also have a spectroscopic redshift. For the point-like source corresponding to SN Eos, our model predicts a total of five images, with the observed radial image pair having a similar magnification of $μ\\simeq 25 - 30$ and a small time delay of $< 5$ days, in agreement with their simultaneous observation. According to the model, the other three predicted images arrived earlier, with time delays of $3.7 \\pm 0.7$, $3.5 \\pm 0.7$ and $54.0 \\pm 10.8$ years prior to the two observed images, and with magnifications of $12.9 \\pm 2.6$, $13.0 \\pm 2.9$ and $2.2 \\pm 0.4$, respectively. The absence of detections at the predicted positions, where the host galaxy's images are also visible, confirms the transient nature of the source. SN Eos and its host galaxy are studied in separate articles, and we here focus on the lens model. The final model reaches a very good $r.m.s.$ distance between model and observations of $0.44''$.

Under the assumption of self-similarity, the Einstein equations reduce to a system of ordinary differential equations, which we solve numerically under boundary conditions enforcing the existence of a minimal areal radius (the throat) on constant-time hypersurfaces. For a sufficiently large throat radius, the resulting geometries remain regular at both spatial and future null infinity, while a singularity is retained in the past direction. We then construct a dynamical formation scenario by patching together three regions: a Schwarzschild black hole, negative-energy Vaidya spacetimes, and the self-similar wormhole geometry. These regions are joined across null shells using the Barrabes--Israel formalism, which provides explicit relations among the throat radius, the black hole's mass and the energy injection by the shell, demonstrating that an initial black hole can evolve into a wormhole. Our analysis generalizes the formation model for static wormhole solutions proposed by Hayward and Koyama in 2004 to non-static wormhole solutions, offering a novel perspective on the formation of regular traversable wormholes."}

In many theoretical studies, streams are modeled with particle-spray or direct N-body codes. But particle-spray methods abstract away the internal dynamics of the progenitor by making strong assumptions about the escape physics, while direct N-body is prohibitively expensive for realistic (N>10^5) systems. In this paper, we present the stream-modeling capabilities of KRIOS, a new basis-expansion N-body code for collisional stellar dynamics, that bridges this runtime vs. accuracy gap. We show that KRIOS reproduces NBODY6++GPU cluster models, and their associated streams, more accurately than particle spray in a fraction of the NBODY6++GPU wall-clock time. We then compare KRIOS to various particle-spray methods on 10 orbits similar to known Milky Way streams. The morphology and kinematics of these streams most disagree when the progenitor is tightly bound to the host, as these systems are often subject to stronger tidal forces. Finally, we discuss which elements of the progenitor physics are most important for modeling stellar streams and how these might be incorporated into particle-spray methods."}

However, this canonical signature relies on the idealization of a continuum of sources without interference. In realistic astrophysical scenarios dominated by supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), interference between discrete sources induces intrinsic deviations in the spatial correlation, which may mimic or obscure signatures of modified gravity. In this work, we derive the closed-form spatial correlation functions for a GWB with arbitrary polarization and generic GW dispersion relations, in the presence of source interference. Through a rigorous harmonic analysis, we demonstrate that source interference modifies the correlation shape but strictly preserves the lowest non-vanishing multipole moment characteristic of each polarization, specifically the quadrupole for tensor, dipole for vector, and monopole for scalar modes. The truncation at higher-order multipoles is governed by the interplay between pulsar distances and dispersion effects. Furthermore, we quantify the statistical degeneracy between interference-induced variation and modified gravity signatures. We conclude that access to only a single realization of the Universe imposes a fundamental theoretical limit on distinguishing modified gravity from GR using spatial correlations alone."}

Neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) can significantly attenuate the emergent Ly$α$ line, even in the damping wing of the cross-section. However, interpreting this damping wing imprint relies on our prior knowledge of the spectrum that escapes from the galaxy and its environs into the IGM. This emergent spectrum is highly sensitive to the composition and geometry of the interstellar and circumgalactic media, and so exhibits a large galaxy to galaxy scatter. Characterizing this scatter is further complicated by non-trivial selection effects introduced by observational surveys. Here we build a flexible, empirical model for the emergent Ly$α$ spectra. Our model characterizes the emergent Ly$α$ luminosity, the velocity offset of the Ly$α$ line with respect to the systemic redshift, and the H$α$ luminosity, with multivariate probability distributions conditioned on the UV magnitude. We constrain these distributions using $z\\sim5-6$ galaxy observations with VLT MUSE and JWST NIRCam, forward-modeling observational selection functions together with galaxy parameters. Our model results in Ly$α$ equivalent width distributions that are a better match to (independent) Subaru observations than previous empirical models. The extended distributions of Ly$α$ equivalent widths and velocity offsets we obtain could facilitate Ly$α$ transmission during the early stages of the EoR. We also illustrate how our model can be used to identify GN-z11-like outliers, potentially originating from merging systems. We publish fitting functions and make our model publicly available."}

In the late Universe, the quintessence field begins to oscillate abruptly, changing the behaviour of $w$. Naturally, such a model entails tachyonic instability, and particle production modifies $w$. We perform numerical lattice simulations to study the time dependence of $w$. In addition, the violent particle production produces significant density perturbations and the stochastic gravitational-wave background, whose characteristic scale depends on the mass scale of the quintessence around the minimum of the potential.

Delayed cooling reduces the baryon mass to half the universal baryon fraction while mechanical feedback retains most baryons, with the hybrid model standing in between. Delayed cooling also ejects significantly more metals into the CGM than both other models.

Physically, one must describe the impact of cosmological bulk flows which progressively and anisotropically smear out the feature over time. One must also model the effects of the scale dependence of tracer bias and the mode coupling between short and long scales. All of these can be incorporated using the Zel'dovich approximation alone, without reference to any particular cosmological model. On the technical front, one needs a robust, complete and cosmology-independent basis to describe the shape of the real space BAO feature in linear theory, which can then be propagated to the nonlinearly evolved, measured feature in redshift space. In this work, we describe how these ingredients -- which we have systematically constructed in recent work -- come together in an accurate framework capable of describing the BAO-scale pairwise measurements of state-of-the-art galaxy surveys. Using mock observations and $N$-body simulations, we show that our template-free framework can produce unbiased and precise cosmological constraints for samples with realistic levels of nonlinearity.

Although all simulations bracket observed column density distributions, direct comparisons are limited by scarce detections and significant scatter in absorption strengths. Covering fractions of weak absorbers provides the most robust constraints. All models fail to reproduce HI and MgII covering fractions, and delayed cooling overproduces OVI covering fractions, while the other models underproduce them.

The method combines regional processing with a hybrid design, utilizing standard convolution and dilated convolution to do a multiscale feature integration. We evaluate performance at both the map and power spectrum level using two masking scenarios: a generated random mask and the Planck 2018 common polarization inpainting mask. For both masking scenarios, SkyReconNet-P reproduces the large-scale morphology of the target maps. In power-spectrum space, we find that the reconstructed $E$-mode spectrum closely tracks the target at low multipoles, while small biases emerge at higher $\\ell$. For $B$-mode, the raw reconstructed spectra exhibit a larger multipole-dependent bias, which we mitigate using a simulation-based linear calibration.

This potential differs from the gravitational potential obtained in other modified gravity theories (e.g. the weak field limit of Yukawa gravity, Modified Newtonian Dynamics, non-local theories, $Λ$ cold dark matter..). Using this model, we are able to define wavelength of the non-linear wave as an analytical solution of integrable non-linear differential equation (namely, non-linear Schrodinger equation). Assuming that the wavelength of the non-linear wave represents the graviton Compton wavelength, we have found the corresponding upper bound of graviton mass. We compare obtained result with first assessments of LIGO $\\&$ Virgo collaboration and we find they are in a good agreement.

While previous OHM surveys have been limited to redshifts of $z \\lesssim 0.25$, the ability to expand the OHM frontier is significantly enhanced with new high-sensitivity radio facilities such as MeerKAT. In this Letter, we report the discovery of an OHM in the gravitational lens system HATLAS J142935.3-002836 at $z = 1.027$, the most distant OHM source yet detected. The spectrum has blended 1667 and 1665 MHz emission and exhibits a highly complex profile, with spectral components ranging in widths of $<8$ km s$^{-1}$ to $\\sim300$ km s$^{-1}$.

Traditional void finding algorithms produce deterministic void catalogs, neglecting the probabilistic nature of the problem. We present a method to sample from the stochastic mapping from galaxy catalogs to arbitrary void definitions. Our algorithm uses a deep graph neural network to evolve \"test particles\" according to a flow-matching objective. We demonstrate the method in a simplified example setting but outline steps to generalize it towards practically usable void finders. Trained on a deterministic teacher, the model performs well but has considerable stochasticity which we interpret as regularization. Cosmological information in the predicted void catalogs outperforms the teacher. On the one hand, our method can cheaply emulate existing void finders with apparently useful regularization. More importantly, it also allows us to find the Bayes-optimal mapping between observed galaxies and any void definition.

The smooth traversable throat induces a logarithmic tortoise coordinate that allows the radial equation to be recast as the quadratic Casimir eigenvalue equation, paralleling the hidden conformal symmetry of the rotating Kerr black hole but arising here in a horizonless geometry. The AdS-Teo spacetime possesses two disconnected timelike AdS conformal boundaries that remain causally connected through the wormhole throat, in contrast to the two-sided eternal AdS black hole where horizons play a central role. Using the emergent conformal symmetry, we construct the near-throat generators, derive the effective potential, and obtain a discrete quasinormal-mode spectrum determined by regularity at the throat and standard AdS boundary conditions at infinity. The AdS embedding further enables a minimal holographic interpretation. As an explicit illustration, we compute an equal-time two-point function in the large-Delta (geodesic) limit from a regulated spacelike geodesic that traverses the wormhole, showing how the bulk geometry couples the two asymptotic boundaries. Together, these results provide a unified description of hidden conformal structure, spectral properties, and boundary correlators in a rotating, horizonless asymptotically AdS wormhole."}

From first-principles stellar physics, the luminosity of a Cepheid is determined by its radius and surface temperature, yielding a fundamental PLC relation whose observational proxies are pulsation period and intrinsic color. Using Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds, we show that the PLC relation recovers the known geometries and line-of-sight tilts of their disks, confirming its ability to detect true distance-modulus variations that are achromatic and consistent across all filters. Surprisingly, for Milky Way Cepheids with individually determined reddenings and HST and Gaia parallaxes, the residuals from multi-wavelength PL fits are also found to be achromatic, identical in sign and amplitude across all passbands, in this case indicating that parallax errors are the dominant source of scatter. Applying bandpass-averaged corrections to individual Cepheids recovers the theoretically expected wavelength-dependent narrowing of the instability strip, and results in revised parallaxes with a median improvement in precision of roughly a factor of two. In addition, they show no statistically significant correlation with metallicity over the range -0.2 < Fe/H < 0.05 dex. The final extinction- and reddening-corrected PLC relation yields an rms scatter of 0.04 mag, corresponding to 2 percent precision in distance per star.

Our results show that across all the considered configurations, the constrained astrophysical parameters are consistent with standard ones from General Relativity. The posterior distributions of $L$ show no preference for non-zero values and result only in upper limits, suggesting that any non-minimal coupling contribution must be small and perturbative on this scales.

We first outline the fundamental framework of MAG, a generalized theory that includes both torsion and non-metricity, and discuss the geometrical significance of torsion within this context. Subsequently, we summarize SVM, a powerful technique that facilitates quantization while effectively incorporating geometrical effects. By integrating these frameworks, we evaluate how the geometrical structures originating from torsion affect quantum fluctuations, demonstrating that they induce non-linearity in quantum mechanics. Notably, torsion, traditionally believed to influence only spin degrees of freedom, can also affect spinless degrees of freedom via quantum fluctuations. Furthermore, extending beyond the results of previous work [Koide and van de Venn, Phys. Rev. A112, 052217 (2025)], we investigate the competitive interplay between the Levi-Civita curvature and torsion within the non-linearity of the Schrödinger equation. Finally, we discuss the structural parallelism between SVM and information geometry, highlighting that the splitting of time derivatives in stochastic processes corresponds to the dual connections in statistical manifolds. These insights pave the way for future extensions to gravity theories involving non-metricity and are expected to deepen our understanding of unresolved cosmological problems."}

We applied SED fitting to constrain properties of the compact infrared objects, and examined the evolutionary states of the extended subregions. We identified 20 compact infrared objects, 16 (80%) of which we classify as massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) or candidate MYSOs. W43 Main resides at the junction of the Scutum spiral arm and the Galactic Bar, a location where enhanced turbulence is anticipated and has been proposed as a potential influence on star-formation activity. Nevertheless, our analysis shows that its Lyman continuum photon production rate, the mass of its most massive MYSO, and its MYSO density are all consistent with the survey-wide median values. We therefore conclude that, despite W43 Main's unique Galactic environment, its present star formation activity appears broadly consistent with that of an average Galactic GHII region."}

In this work, we study how uncertainties in the binary formation channel affect the predicted cross-correlation signal for both current-generation and next-generation networks of detectors. We generate five mock GW catalogues for which we vary the progenitor-to-remnant mass-transfer function and the time-delay probability distribution between progenitor and remnant. We then cross-correlate these catalogues with galaxy samples modelled on the 2MASS Photometric Redshift catalogue (2MPZ) and the Gaia-unWISE quasar catalogue (Quaia). We find that the mass-transfer function has negligible effect on the cross-correlation signal, with differences remaining within redshift uncertainties. In contrast, the time-delay distribution dramatically affects the redshift distribution of the GW events and, with it, the cross-correlation signal, particularly for shallow galaxy catalogues. In particular, current-generation facilities can achieve significant detections only for the longest time delays when cross-correlated with 2MPZ, whilst all cross-correlations with the deeper Quaia catalogue are marginally detectable or consistent with zero. Our exploratory results thus demonstrate that forecasts on cosmological or astrophysical parameters derived from GW-galaxy cross-correlations are, as expected, strongly sensitive to the assumed binary formation history."}

Malaeb"], "title": "The Theoretical Landscape of Mimetic Gravity: A Comprehensive Review", "comment": null, "summary": "Mimetic gravity has emerged as a compelling extension of General Relativity (GR), originally motivated by the attempt to isolate the conformal degree of freedom of the gravitational field. By reparametrizing the physical metric in terms of an auxiliary metric and a scalar field, the theory naturally gives rise to a longitudinal degree of freedom that mimics the behavior of cold dark matter. This review provides a comprehensive survey of the theoretical landscape of mimetic gravity and its multifaceted applications to cosmology and high-energy physics. We begin by examining the original formulation and addressing the fundamental question of its equivalence to GR, highlighting how a singular disformal transformation introduces new physical degrees of freedom. We then explore minimal generalizations that lead to unified cosmological models, including mimetic matter scenarios and extensions into $f(R, φ)$ gravity, which allow for the reconstruction of any desired expansion history. Significant attention is given to the ``limiting curvature'' hypothesis through $f(\\Box φ)$ modifications, providing a classical mechanism for resolving cosmological and black hole singularities. We critically assess the challenges facing the theory, specifically the gradient and ghost instabilities identified in cosmological perturbations, and discuss modern resolutions such as ghost-free mimetic massive gravity and covariant formulations of Hořava gravity. Finally, we discuss the role of the mimetic field in the early universe, specifically in the context of asymptotically free gravity and the resolution of the self-reproduction problem in inflation."}

From this parent sample, we select 24 systems with high-quality ancillary data for joint analysis of strong lensing geometry and stellar kinematics. A key contribution is the derivation of new single-aperture stellar velocity dispersions for 11 lens galaxies via an iterative spectroscopic fitting procedure that mitigates quasar contamination, providing previously unavailable data. We model the total mass-density profile as a power law, $ρ\\propto r^{-γ}$, and parameterise its logarithmic slope as $γ= γ_0 + γ_z \\cdot z_l + γ_s \\cdot \\log \\tildeΣ$, where $z_l$ is the lens redshift and $\\tildeΣ$ the surface mass density. Within a flat $Λ$CDM framework and using DESI BAO measurements as a prior, we constrain the parameters via Monte Carlo nested sampling to $γ_0 = 1.62^{+0.11}_{-0.12}$, $γ_z = -0.35^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$, and $γ_s = 0.37^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ ($68\\%$ confidence intervals). Our results robustly demonstrate that $γ$ increases with surface mass density ($γ_s > 0$) and decreases with redshift ($γ_z < 0$). This implies that, at fixed redshift, galaxies with denser stellar cores have steeper mass profiles, while at fixed density, profiles become shallower at higher redshifts. By successfully applying the joint lensing--dynamics method to a substantial, independently acquired sample of lensed quasars, this work provides crucial validation of structural trends previously observed in galaxy--galaxy lensing systems, reinforcing the established evolutionary picture for massive ETGs and establishing lensed quasars as a potent probe of galaxy structure."}

To help gain insight into these problems, we carry out time-dependent chemical modelling of cool clouds in the Milky Way's nuclear wind, which possess unusual molecularto-atomic hydrogen ratios that are inconsistent with both disc values and predictions from chemical equilibrium models. We confirm that CO and Hi emission comparable to that in the observed nuclear wind clouds cannot be produced by gas in chemical equilibrium, but that such conditions can be produced in a molecule-dominated cloud that has had its atomic envelope rapidly removed and has not yet reached a new chemical equilibrium. Clouds in this state harbour large reservoirs of molecular gas and consequently have anomalously large CO-to-H2 conversion factors, suggesting that the masses of the observed clouds may be significantly larger than suggested by earlier analyses assuming disc-like conversions. These findings provide a new framework for interpreting cold gas in galactic winds, providing strong evidence that cold outflows can originate from the galactic disc molecular clouds that survive acceleration into the wind but lose their diffuse atomic envelopes in the process, and suggesting that the Milky Way's nuclear outflow may be more heavily mass-loaded than previously thought."}

It is possible to compute the creation and evolution of anisotropic signals for various scenarios using the frequency hierarchy method recently developed for CosmoTherm.

Here, we carefully construct a modified form for the evolution equations that has the full equilibrium solutions built into the formulation. We improve the formalism to account for i) additional stimulated scattering effects, ii) kinematic corrections to the thermalization terms, iii) corrections to the standard perturbation variables and iv) direct photon sources. These effect could not be captured with the original formulation of the frequency hierarchy method but are indeed important for cleanly separating real distortions from temperature signals. However, we show that previous results are not altered significantly when compared to the improved formulation presented here. As a new worked example, which could indeed not be treated before, we also illustrate how possible changes in the temperature-redshift relation would create spectral distortion anisotropies in the pre-recombination era.

A rolling scalar field drives the kination epoch. In the specific model we consider, its derivative coupling to a second scalar (tunneling field) dynamically traps the latter in a false vacuum, with the phase transition triggered as the kination field slows due to Hubble friction. We compute the resulting stochastic GW background from bubble nucleation and collisions, presenting analytic estimates and numerical results for the peak amplitude and frequency. In all cases we find an upper bound $Ω_{\\rm GW} h^2\\lesssim 2\\times10^{-7}$ from the bubble percolation condition.

To be submitted to AAS journals in a week. Comments are welcome", "summary": "Magnetic properties of dust grains play a fundamental role in their alignment with ambient magnetic fields and magnetic dipole emission. In the radiative torque (RAT) paradigm, superparamagnetic inclusions (SPIs) embedded within dust grains are expected to significantly enhance magnetic susceptibility and alignment efficiency. Previous studies have generally assumed SPIs of a single characteristic size. In this work, we develop an effective superparamagnetism model that explicitly accounts for a power-law size distribution of SPIs. We show that the effective zero-frequency susceptibility can be described by the superparamagnetic susceptibility of uniform-sized inclusions evaluated at the critical blocking size, reduced by a factor $F_{\\rm eff}\\sim 0.1$. It exhibits a slight increase with dust temperature $T_{d}$, in contrast to the rapid decrease for the case of single-size SPIs. For rotating grains at angular frequency $ω$, we identify a characteristic resonance size of SPIs that dominates the magnetic response, $N_{\\rm res} = (T_{d}/T_{\\rm act}) \\ln (ν_{0}/ω)$ with $T_{\\rm act}$ activation temperature and $ν_{0}$ the characteristic attempt frequency of SPIs. The frequency-dependent effective susceptibility is well described by the maximum susceptibility $χ_{\\rm eff}^{\\rm max}(ω)$ at $N_{\\rm res}$, reduced by a factor $G_{\\rm eff}\\sim 0.1$. Unlike models assuming uniform-sized inclusions, we find that the effective susceptibility exhibits a nearly flat spectrum for frequency below $ν_{0}$, arising from the progressive activation of larger inclusions at lower frequencies. This effective superparamagnetism model based on the SPI size distrbution has important implications for magnetic grain alignment, dust polarization, and magnetic dipole emission across diverse environments."}

We investigate DM production in a PBH-dominated cosmological framework, including contributions from PBH evaporation, gravitational production, and thermal freeze-in and freeze-out mechanisms, and determine the regions consistent with the observed DM relic abundance. We find that thermal freeze-in can compensate for the underabundance of PBH-sourced DM, while indirect detection remains largely insensitive due to the feeble interaction strength, making future GW observatories such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope (ET) unique probes of this scenario. For freeze-out DM, indirect detection experiments constrain regions with relatively large annihilation cross-sections, whereas GW observations probe complementary regions with heavier DM masses and smaller interaction strengths. Consequently, the same DM parameter space cannot be simultaneously probed by both indirect detection searches and GW missions. These results establish GW observations as a powerful and independent probe of DM production in PBH-dominated cosmologies, opening a new observational window into DM properties and the thermal history of the pre-BBN Universe."}

A non-negligible fraction of these SMBHs are hosted in galaxies with BH-to-galaxy mass ratios ($M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star$) being excessively larger than that for local SMBHs by $\\sim 1-2$ dex. The origin of these ``overmassive'' BHs remains elusive, demanding either a heavy seed formation scenario or rapid growth of seed BHs. Their deviation from local scaling relations challenges our understanding of how SMBHs and their host galaxies coevolve across cosmic time. In this paper, we apply phenomenological modelings for BHs and galaxies to dark matter halo merger histories from N-body simulations to investigate the subsequent evolution of JWST-discovered ``overmassive'' SMBHs. We find that early evolution of ``overmassive'' SMBHs is dominated by stunted accretion leading to gradual decreases in $M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star$ ratios. In contrast, less massive SMBHs experience super-Eddington accretion during their early evolution, resulting in a slow increase of mass ratios toward $M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star \\sim 0.01$. Convergence occurs at $M_{\\rm BH}\\sim 10^8~M_\\odot$ with $M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star \\sim 0.01$.

However, this canonical signature relies on the idealization of a continuum of sources without interference. In realistic astrophysical scenarios dominated by supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), interference between discrete sources induces intrinsic deviations in the spatial correlation, which may mimic or obscure signatures of modified gravity. In this work, we derive the closed-form spatial correlation functions for a GWB with arbitrary polarization and generic GW dispersion relations, in the presence of source interference. Through a rigorous harmonic analysis, we demonstrate that source interference modifies the correlation shape but strictly preserves the lowest non-vanishing multipole moment characteristic of each polarization, specifically the quadrupole for tensor, dipole for vector, and monopole for scalar modes. The truncation at higher-order multipoles is governed by the interplay between pulsar distances and dispersion effects. Furthermore, we quantify the statistical degeneracy between interference-induced variation and modified gravity signatures. We conclude that access to only a single realization of the Universe imposes a fundamental theoretical limit on distinguishing modified gravity from GR using spatial correlations alone."}

This effect provides a simple interpretation for the acceleration interpolation relation required to modify the kinematics of a test particle in the Modified Inertial interpretation of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). This effect can be regarded as a generalization of the thermal blackbody spectrum generated by the Unruh effect (which arises from long-time uniform acceleration in a flat background) to the scenario of local short-time non-uniform acceleration. This effect offers a unified framework for understanding the accelerated expansion of the universe and the anomalies in galactic rotation curves or radial acceleration. It is worth emphasizing that this modified kinematic interpretation of MOND necessitates a quantum equivalence principle as its physical foundation, that is, extending the equivalence at the level of expectation values (first-order moments) in the classical equivalence principle to the equivalence at the level of second-order moment quantum fluctuations. Therefore, the role of this effect within the frameworks of quantum reference frames and quantum gravity is also discussed to some extent."}

Our analysis combines (i) GAMA spectroscopic redshift survey data to optically select galaxy groups and reconstruct the cosmic web, (ii) eROSITA data to identify X-ray-emitting groups, and (iii) SAMI Galaxy Survey data to characterise spatially-resolved star formation. We find that galaxies in X-ray+optical groups exhibit the lowest median C-index and the highest fraction of centrally-concentrated star-forming galaxies relative to optical groups and the field (independently of group or stellar mass). Star-forming galaxies in more X-ray luminous groups at fixed dynamical mass show more concentrated star formation. At large scales, nodes show the lowest median C-index and the highest fraction of centrally-concentrated star-forming galaxies relative to filaments and voids, which have similar C-index distributions. C-index correlates most strongly with the distance to the closest node, leaving no significant role for other local or large-scale environment metrics. Finally, regular star-forming galaxies tend to have spins aligned parallel to filaments, consistent with smooth gas accretion, while centrally-concentrated galaxies tend have spins aligned perpendicular to filaments, likely driven by mergers and associated with bulge growth. These results suggest that multi-scale environmental processes, i.e. locally and at large-scale, act to concentrate star formation toward galaxy centres, via gas-related mechanisms in nodes and ram-pressure stripping in X-ray+optical groups."}

An initial state different from the vacuum turns out to be marginally permitted in the low frequency range (associated with the largest observable wavelengths that crossed the comoving Hubble radius) while the intermediate and high frequency domains of the spectrum are populated by the gravitons produced from the vacuum. The non classical correlations are expected to dominate between the kHz and the THz since in this region gravitons are produced quantum mechanically with a negligible contribution from the initial state."}

The models reproduce the general trends, with cyanopolyyne and polyynyl radical abundances decreasing as molecular size increases, but they underestimate the abundances of cyanopolyynes longer than $\\mathrm{HC_5N}$ by up to two orders of magnitude. Current models, which include the dominant neutral-neutral formation routes, cannot account for this discrepancy, suggesting that the chemical network is incomplete. We propose that additional ion-molecule reactions are crucial for the formation of these species. Developing a more comprehensive chemical network for long carbon chains is essential for accurately interpreting present and future observations."}

The equation of state determines a large number of neutron star properties, such as tidal deformability, radius, and quadrupole moment, several of which directly affect the emitted gravitational-wave signals. To reduce the dimensionality when computing gravitational-waves and when interpreting observational data, quasi-universal relations are commonly employed to connect different neutron star properties. However, quasi-universal relations are not exact and their use may introduce uncertainty and bias. We explore the potential biases arising from different quasi-universal relations in the third generation era: (i) the Love-Q relation connecting the spin-induced quadrupole moment and the tidal deformability, (ii) the relation between the fundamental mode frequency and the tidal deformability, and (iii) the binary Love relation. We find that for the quadrupole relation biases are only present for rapidly rotating systems, for the binary-Love relation induces moderate biases only in the next-to-leading-order tidal parameters, which can however propagate into the inferred equation of state at low masses. Regarding fundamental mode frequencies, we find that the employed relation introduces only negligible biases, while waveform systematic effects can become comparatively large. Our results highlight that while quasi-universal relations remain a useful tool within gravitational-wave analyses, careful treatment is needed to avoid biases in equation of state measurements with next-generation detectors."}

The decline is dominated by a decrease in weak bars, while the fraction of strong bars remains largely unchanged. Bar suppression is primarily associated with major mergers and is strongest in massive host galaxies. A weaker but statistically significant suppression is detected in minor mergers only for massive galaxies with small bulges. In contrast, no significant dependence of bar suppression on the relative orientation between pair members is found.

Typical rotational temperatures in the hot core SMA1 fall in the range 100--200 K. Optical depths in the lines of methanol and some other molecules in the cores SMA1 and SMA2 were estimated. In SMA1, the optical depth of one of the strongest methanol lines, $5_{-1}-4_{-1}E$, proved to be $23.8 \\pm 1.5$. Based on this value, one can assume that the lines of other oxygen-containing COMs, such as CH$_3$OCHO, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, CH$_3$CH$_2$OH, which are typically much less abundant in hot cores than methanol, are optically thin in SMA1.\n  Most of the detected molecules can be roughly divided into two groups. The molecules of the first group emit exclusively toward the hot core SMA1, while some or all lines of the molecules of the second group, in addition to SMA1, can be seen toward a ring-like structure to the west of SMA1. This structure is most likely associated with the walls of a cavity formed by high-velocity outflows driven by young stellar objects (YSOs) in molecular cores SMA1, SMA2, and possibly SMA3. The gas temperature and density in the cavity walls were estimated using methanol lines. The temperature was found to be about 50--60 K, and the density about $10^7-10^8$ cm$^{-3}$. The column density of methanol near the brightness peaks in the lines of this molecule is about $5\\times 10^{15}$~cm$^{-2}$. The column densities of other COMs in the ring-like structure will be determined in future studies with increased sensitivity achieved by spectral line stacking."}

We identify 10 new multiple-image systems in recent VENUS JWST/NIRCam imaging, so that the model is constrained with a total of 19 robust multiple-image systems -- nine of which also have a spectroscopic redshift. For the point-like source corresponding to SN Eos, our model predicts a total of five images, with the observed radial image pair having a similar magnification of $μ\\simeq 25 - 30$ and a small time delay of $< 5$ days, in agreement with their simultaneous observation. According to the model, the other three predicted images arrived earlier, with time delays of $3.7 \\pm 0.7$, $3.5 \\pm 0.7$ and $54.0 \\pm 10.8$ years prior to the two observed images, and with magnifications of $12.9 \\pm 2.6$, $13.0 \\pm 2.9$ and $2.2 \\pm 0.4$, respectively. The absence of detections at the predicted positions, where the host galaxy's images are also visible, confirms the transient nature of the source. SN Eos and its host galaxy are studied in separate articles, and we here focus on the lens model. The final model reaches a very good $r.m.s.$ distance between model and observations of $0.44''$. We present the lens-modeling results, including newly identified systems such as a triply imaged, grand-design spiral galaxy candidate at $z \\simeq 3.65_{-0.09}^{+0.04}$, and briefly discuss the potential of using high-redshift lensed SNe for cosmography."}

The statistical promise of this method, however, places stringent demands on waveform accuracy and detector calibration, as even small systematic errors can dominate over statistical uncertainties at high signal-to-noise ratios. We investigate the impact of waveform-modeling systematics on golden dark siren cosmology using a synthetic population of binary black holes consistent with current GW observations and analyzed in the XG-detector era. By comparing state-of-the-art waveform models against numerical-relativity-based reference signals, we quantify modeling inaccuracies from both modeling and data-analysis perspectives and assess how they propagate into biases in luminosity distance, host-galaxy association, and single-event $H_0$ inference. We find that while current waveform models often allow recovery of statistically consistent $H_0$ posteriors, small waveform-induced biases can significantly affect three-dimensional localization and host galaxy ranking, occasionally leading to incorrect redshift assignments. We further derive order-of-magnitude requirements on detector calibration accuracy needed to ensure that calibration systematics remain subdominant for golden dark sirens observed with XG networks. To realize sub-percent $H_0$ measurements with golden dark sirens will require waveform and calibration accuracies that scale as $\\mathcal{O}(ρ^{-2})$ with signal-to-noise ratio, motivating sustained advances in waveform modeling, numerical relativity, and detector calibration for the XG era."}

Accepted for publication in ApJ", "summary": "We present imaging and spectroscopic analyses of Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of ACT-CL J0123.5$-$0428, one of the most massive, highest redshift galaxy clusters detected within the survey fields of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The Chandra data are sufficient to characterize the morphology of this cluster and constrain the geometrically deprojected temperature in 2 spatial bins out to $r_{2500}$, revealing a dynamically relaxed system whose temperature drops to $kT = 1.8\\pm0.6$ keV in the inner $\\sim40$kpc. Within this same inner radius, the surface brightness and density of the ICM is sharply peaked, and the cooling time falls to $t_\\mathrm{cool}=280^{+150}_{-120}$ Myr. A novel forward-modeling analysis of the XMM data extends imaging and spectroscopic measurements of this system out to $r_{500}$, constraining the redshift to $z=1.50\\pm0.03$, with a mean temperature of $kT = 7.3\\pm1.1$ keV and an emission-weighted mean metallicity of $Z/Z_\\odot = 0.43^{+0.46}_{-0.25}$. We also utilize the limited optical/IR photometric coverage of the cluster to characterize the properties of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), which is coincident with the X-ray peak. Despite the high redshift and strong cool core, the BCG exhibits no signs of recent or ongoing star formation, suggesting AGN feedback has been acting persistently to stem star formation since $z\\sim 2.5$. These measurements identify ACT-CL J0123.5$-$0428 as the highest redshift, dynamically relaxed, cool core galaxy cluster discovered to date, making it a premier target for future astrophysical and cosmological studies."}

Within this framework, non-relativistic matter fields admit a covariant description, while the physical Newtonian dynamics is recovered through an immersion into the usual $3+1$ spacetime. By adopting a Gödel-like metric ansatz and coupling the gravitational field to a Galilean fluid derived from a variational principle, we obtain a system of highly nonlinear and coupled field equations. Exact solutions are constructed by fixing the matter sector consistently with the field equations. The resulting configurations describe rotating non-relativistic universes and satisfy $D(x)>H(x)$ throughout the entire spatial domain. As a consequence, the associated Killing vector remains spacelike everywhere and no closed timelike curves arise."}

While the data suggest the possibility of the phantom crossing, it is worth thoroughly exploring quintessence models. Given that phenomenological parametrisations of the equation-of-state parameter $w(a)$ with a sharp transitional feature fit the data well, we study the realisation of such models in quintessence. In the late Universe, the quintessence field begins to oscillate abruptly, changing the behaviour of $w$. Naturally, such a model entails tachyonic instability, and particle production modifies $w$. We perform numerical lattice simulations to study the time dependence of $w$. In addition, the violent particle production produces significant density perturbations and the stochastic gravitational-wave background, whose characteristic scale depends on the mass scale of the quintessence around the minimum of the potential. We discuss the observability of these late-time cosmological signals through cosmic microwave background, quasar astrometry, pulsar timing arrays, and other observational probes."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "We investigate whether a non-minimal coupling between dark matter and gravity can influence the internal dynamics of ultra-diffuse galaxies. Within this framework, the gravitational potential is modified by an additional term that captures the interaction between spacetime curvature and the dark matter with a coupling constant determined by a length scale $L$. Using spherical Jeans modeling, we analyze the kinematic data of three ultra-diffuse galaxies namely: NGC\\;1052-DF2, NGC\\;1052-DF4, and Dragonfly\\;44, which span the observational extremes from dark matter deficient to dark matter dominated systems. For each galaxy we explore several dark matter halo profiles, two orbital anisotropy models, and both with and without Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation scenarios, and we perform a Bayesian parameter inference. Our results show that across all the considered configurations, the constrained astrophysical parameters are consistent with standard ones from General Relativity. The posterior distributions of $L$ show no preference for non-zero values and result only in upper limits, suggesting that any non-minimal coupling contribution must be small and perturbative on this scales. Future high precision velocity measurements will be essential to determine whether non-minimal coupling effects can become observationally distinguishable in low-acceleration systems."}
