We show that a subset of these non-polynomial gravities, referred to as non-polynomial quasi-topological gravities, admit single-function static spherically symmetric solutions whereby the metric function is determined by an algebraic equation.

The L1157-mm outflow is the only low-mass protostellar outflow that has extensively been studied in this regard. Using the data taken as part of the PRODIGE (PROtostars & DIsks: Global Evolution) large program, we aim to map COM emission and derive the molecular composition of the protostellar outflow driven by the Class 0 protostar NGC1333 IRAS4B1 to introduce it as a new laboratory to study the impact of shocks on COM chemistry. In addition to typical outflow tracers such as SiO and CO, outflow emission is seen from H2CO, HNCO, and HC3N, as well as from the COMs CH3OH, CH3CN, and CH3CHO, and even from deuterated species such as DCN, D2CO, and CH2DOH. Maps of integrated intensity ratios between CH3OH and DCN, D2CO, and CH3CHO reveal gradients with distance from the protostar. Intensity ratio maps of HC3N and CH3CN with respect to CH3OH peak in the southern lobe where temperatures are highest. Rotational temperatures derived towards two positions, one in each lobe, are found in the range ~50-100 K. Abundances with respect to CH3OH are higher by factors of a few than for the L1157-B1. In conclusion, for the first time, we securely detected the COMs CH3CN, CH3CHO, and CH2DOH in the IRAS 4B1 outflow, serendipitously with limited sensitivity and bandwidth. Targeted observations will enable the discovery of new COMs and a more detailed analysis of their emission. Morphological differences between molecules in the IRAS 4B1 outflow lobes and their relative abundances provide first proof that this outflow is a promising new laboratory for shock chemistry, which will offer crucial information on COM formation and destruction as well as outflow structure and kinematics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528PRODIGE\u5927\u578b\u89c2\u6d4b\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u539f\u6052\u661f\u5916\u6d41IRAS 4B1\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u590d\u6742\u6709\u673a\u5206\u5b50\uff08COMs\uff09CH3CN\u3001CH3CHO\u548cCH2DOH\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u4e30\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u5916\u6d41\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u6fc0\u6ce2\u5316\u5b66\u7684\u65b0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u6fc0\u6ce2\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u6709\u673a\u5206\u5b50\uff08COMs\uff09\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u7834\u574f\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u9664L1157-mm\u5916\u65b0\u7684\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u539f\u6052\u661f\u6fc0\u6ce2\u5316\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u6837\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8ePRODIGE\u5927\u578b\u9879\u76ee\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bf9NGC1333 IRAS4B1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u539f\u6052\u661f\u5916\u6d41\u8fdb\u884cCOM\u53d1\u5c04\u6210\u56fe\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u79ef\u5206\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6bd4\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u6e29\u5ea6\u53ca\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e30\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u5c55\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230SiO\u3001CO\u3001H2CO\u3001HNCO\u3001HC3N\u3001CH3OH\u3001CH3CN\u3001CH3CHO\u3001DCN\u3001D2CO\u3001CH2DOH\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u5b50\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0CH3OH\u4e0eDCN/D2CO/CH3CHO\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6bd4\u968f\u8ddd\u79bb\u53d8\u5316\uff1bHC3N/CH3CN\u4e0eCH3OH\u4e4b\u6bd4\u5728\u5357\u74e3\u5cf0\u503c\u533a\uff1b\u65cb\u8f6c\u6e29\u5ea6\u7ea650\u2013100 K\uff1bCOM\u76f8\u5bf9CH3OH\u4e30\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e8eL1157-B1\u6570\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "IRAS 4B1\u5916\u6d41\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u6fc0\u6ce2\u5316\u5b66\u7684\u65b0\u5174\u7406\u60f3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\uff0c\u5176\u5206\u5b50\u5f62\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0e\u4e30\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u4e3aCOM\u5f62\u6210/\u7834\u574f\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5916\u6d41\u7ed3\u6784\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u540e\u7eed\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u89c2\u6d4b\u6709\u671b\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u591aCOM\u5e76\u6df1\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

Two analytic models are analyzed, allowing a systematic study of circular geodesics, photon-sphere properties, shadow radius, Lyapunov exponent, ISCO frequency, binding energy, and Hawking temperature. The corrected numerical results show that the halo scale parameter can significantly modify strong-field observables. In both models, for moderate density slopes, increasing the halo parameter reduces characteristic radii while enhancing orbital instability and accretion efficiency. For steeper density falloff, however, deviations from the Schwarzschild case remain small.

MIDIS is the deepest JWST/MIRI survey to date, probing faint limits and enabling studies of rare high-redshift galaxy populations. We define MIRI-red sources as those detected at 5$\u03c3$ significance in MIRI/F560W with red colors: $m_{\\rm F444W} - m_{\\rm F560W} \\ge 0.5$. Using an empirical methodology, we estimate the purity and completeness of MIRI detections and find that a 5-sigma detection at 28.75 mag has a purity of 92\\% and completeness of 54\\%. We identify seven MIRI-red galaxy candidates, including an F115W dropout consistent with a high-redshift galaxy candidate. We explore possible physical origins for the MIRI-red population, including active galactic nuclei, dust-obscured galaxies, extreme emission-line galaxies, evolved stellar populations, and Little Red Dots (LRDs). Given the proximity of the F444W and F560W filters and the depth of MIDIS, MIRI-red galaxies are consistent with emission-line galaxies with $EW_0(H\u03b1) \\ge 750$ \u00c5 or $EW_0(H\u03b2+ [OIII]) \\ge 600$ \u00c5, or high-redshift Balmer breaks of at least 1.6. We also discuss an extreme MIRI-red galaxy undetected in F444W, a potential MIRI-only source, for which we derive $EW_0(H\u03b1) \\sim 6000$ \u00c5 and $EW_0(H\u03b2+ [OIII]) \\sim 4000$ \u00c5, or high-$z$ LRD analogs with Balmer breaks of 6.3. Finally, we find fewer MIRI-red detections than expected from extrapolations of the H$\u03b1$ or H$\u03b2$+[OIII] line luminosity functions, consistent with previous deep searches, while the absence of $z>10$ LRD candidates agrees with theoretical expectations for the MIDIS volume.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528JWST/MIRI\u6df1\u573a\u5de1\u5929\u6570\u636e\uff08MIDIS\uff09\u63a2\u6d4b\u5e76\u5206\u67905.6\u5fae\u7c73\u6ce2\u6bb5\u201cMIRI-red\u201d\u661f\u7cfb\u5019\u9009\u4f53\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u8d77\u6e90\u4e8e\u5f3a\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\u661f\u7cfb\u6216\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u5df4\u5c14\u672b\u65ad\u88c2\u661f\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u63a2\u6d4b\u7684\u7eaf\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u7406\u89e3JWST/MIRI\u6700\u6df1\u5de1\u5929\u4e2d\u7f55\u89c1\u76845.6\u5fae\u7c73\u8fc7\u4eae\uff08MIRI-red\uff09\u661f\u7cfb\u5019\u9009\u4f53\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u7269\u7406\u8d77\u6e90\uff08\u5982AGN\u3001\u5c18\u57c3\u906e\u853d\u661f\u7cfb\u3001\u5f3a\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\u661f\u7cfb\u3001\u6f14\u5316\u6052\u661f\u79cd\u7fa4\u6216Little Red Dots\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u661f\u7cfb\u6f14\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eMIRI/F560W 5\u03c3\u63a2\u6d4b\u5b9a\u4e49MIRI-red\u6e90\uff08F444W\u2212F560W \u2265 0.5\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a2\u6d4b\u7eaf\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u6d4b\u5149\u4e0e\u5149\u8c31\u7ebf\u7b49\u6548\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff08EW\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6210\u56e0\uff1b\u5e76\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u5149\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u53ca\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fbLRD\u9884\u671f\u6570\u91cf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa7\u4e2aMIRI-red\u661f\u7cfb\u5019\u9009\u4f53\uff0c\u5305\u62ec1\u4e2aF115W drop-out\u9ad8-z\u5019\u9009\u4f53\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u6781\u7aefMIRI-only\u6e90\uff0c\u5176H\u03b1\u7b49\u6548\u5bbd\u5ea6\u8fbe~6000 \u00c5\uff1b\u63a2\u6d4b\u7eaf\u5ea692%\u3001\u5b8c\u5907\u602754%\uff0828.75 mag\uff09\uff1b\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684MIRI-red\u6e90\u6570\u91cf\u5c11\u4e8eH\u03b1/H\u03b2+[OIII]\u5149\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u5916\u63a8\u9884\u671f\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u53d1\u73b0z>10\u7684LRD\u5019\u9009\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "MIRI-red\u661f\u7cfb\u4e3b\u8981\u5bf9\u5e94\u5f3a\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\u661f\u7cfb\uff08EW\u2080(H\u03b1)\u2265750 \u00c5\uff09\u6216\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u5df4\u5c14\u672b\u65ad\u88c2\u661f\u7cfb\uff08\u65ad\u88c2\u22651.6\uff09\uff1b\u6781\u7aefMIRI-only\u6e90\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u9ad8z LRD\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4f53\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u51f8\u663eMIDIS\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u7279\u6b8a\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Considering Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) observations at $154.2~\\mathrm{MHz}$ ($z=8.2$), we mitigate the foregrounds with Smooth Component Filtering (SCF) and estimate the 21 cm BS. We validate the pipeline using a simulated 21 cm signal and show that the input BS is recovered for modes $k_{\\parallel} \\ge [k_\\parallel]_f=0.135~{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Applied to actual data, the SCF produces substantial foreground suppression, reducing the amplitude of the cylindrical BS $B(k_{1\\perp},k_{2\\perp},k_{3\\perp},k_{1\\parallel},k_{2\\parallel})$ by $3-4$ orders of magnitude. The artifacts due to the missing frequency channels in the data are also suppressed. The resulting EoR window is significantly cleaner at small $k_{\\perp}$. We adopt the region $(k_{1 \\perp},k_{2 \\perp},k_{3 \\perp})\\leq 0.026~{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $(k_{1\\parallel},k_{2\\parallel},k_{3\\parallel})>0.135~{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ to evaluate the 3D spherical BS and constrain the EoR signal. By combining estimates over all triangle shapes, we place the lower and upper limits on the mean cube brightness temperature fluctuations $\u0394^3$.

The presence of a local maximum allows for unstable circular orbits to exist similar to light rings present in actual BH solutions, while it has been conjectured that the presence of a local minimum is symptomatic of potential instabilities. One such candidate for a BHM is a solitonic boson star (SBS) which is a boson star endowed with a sextic potential. In this paper we investigate further solutions of static and spherically symmetric SBSs in general relativity with a larger set of parameter values, and argue that such solutions are very similar to UCOs composed of an incompressible perfect fluid (IPF) with a sufficiently large pressure (the mimicker of a BHM). These IPFUCOs reach the Buchdahl limit $C= 4/9$ for arbitrarily large pressures. We investigate the extent to which the IPFUCOs constructed within a quadratic model in $f(R)$ gravity can overcome this limit or not, and thus pave the way for possibly building SBSs (or other kind of UCO) within this (or other alternative theory of gravity). We further elaborate about the stability properties of SBSs which have been the subject of some controversy recently.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65e0\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89c6\u754c\u3001\u5168\u5c40\u6b63\u5219\u7684\u8d85\u7d27\u51d1\u5929\u4f53\uff08UCOs\uff09\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5177\u6709\u516d\u6b21\u52bf\u7684\u5b64\u5b50\u578b\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u661f\uff08SBS\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6a21\u4eff\u8005\uff08BHMs\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6d41\u4f53\uff08IPF\uff09UCOs\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u53caf(R)\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7a81\u7834Buchdahl\u6781\u9650\uff08C=4/9\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86SBS\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e89\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u80fd\u66ff\u4ee3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u3001\u4e0d\u5177\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89c6\u754c\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u81f4\u5bc6\u5929\u4f53\uff08\u5373\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6a21\u4eff\u8005\uff09\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5b64\u5b50\u578b\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u661f\uff1b\u68c0\u9a8c\u5176\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u7a81\u7834\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6d41\u4f53UCOs\u7684Buchdahl\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u5398\u6e05\u8fd1\u671f\u5173\u4e8eSBS\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4e89\u8bae\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9759\u6001\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u573a\u65b9\u7a0b\u6c42\u89e3\u5b64\u5b50\u578b\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u661f\uff08SBS\uff09\u89e3\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u56f4\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u9ad8\u538b\u529b\u4e0d\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6d41\u4f53\uff08IPF\uff09UCOs\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u4e8c\u6b21f(R)\u5f15\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u6784\u9020IPFUCOs\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u5176\u80fd\u5426\u7a81\u7834C=4/9\u6781\u9650\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u5df2\u6709\u6587\u732e\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc4\u8ff0SBS\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0SBS\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u6269\u5c55\u540e\u4e0e\u9ad8\u538b\u529bIPFUCOs\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\uff1bIPFUCOs\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e2d\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4f46\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc7Buchdahl\u6781\u9650C=4/9\uff1b\u5728\u6240\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21f(R)\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0cIPFUCOs\u4ecd\u672a\u7a81\u7834\u8be5\u6781\u9650\uff1bSBS\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6784\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5f84\u5411\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8fd1\u671f\u90e8\u5206\u8d28\u7591\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "SBS\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6a21\u4eff\u8005\u5019\u9009\u8005\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u52bf\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\uff1b\u5f53\u524df(R)\u6a21\u578b\u5c1a\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u52a9\u5176\u7a81\u7834Buchdahl\u6781\u9650\uff1b\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u5f15\u529b\u6216\u573a\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7a33\u5b9aUCOs\u3002"}}

This yields a compact non-linear evolution equation for the Eulerian density contrast, controlled by a time- and density-dependent effective gravitational strength, and provides a direct map between model functions and void observables. We apply the framework to the luminal Galileon class of models, where derivative self-interactions generate Vainshtein screening and might lead to a breakdown of the physical branch in sufficiently underdense regions. Exploiting this feature, we apply the void-informed viability requirement that translates into bounds on the theory parameter space and, equivalently, on the minimum attainable void depth as a function of redshift. For viable parameters of a concrete model, we quantify the impact of MG on isolated void evolution, the Lagrangian to Eulerian mapping, and the shell-crossing threshold. Relative to GR, we find a clear hierarchy of MG effects, with ${\\cal O}(10\\%)$ modifications in the gravitational couplings, percent-level shifts in the void density evolution, and sub-percent deviations in both the mapping and the shell-crossing thresholds. Moreover, within the adopted parametrization, we show analytically that voids always lie in an unscreened regime on the physical branch.

Gas-Phase and Ice-Surface Mechanisms involving Secondary Sulfur Products", "comment": "Revised version submitted to A&A", "summary": "The formation pathways of sulfur-bearing species in the interstellar medium are crucial to understand astrochemical processes in cold molecular clouds and to gain new insights about the sulfur budget in these regions. We aim to explore the recently detected, thioethanal (CH$_{3}$CHS) formation mechanisms from thioethanol (CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH) as a precursor in addition to secondary sulfur products. The electronic structure methods and density functional theory for both gas-phase and ice-grain surface environments is employed. To mimic interstellar ice-mantles, we use medium (W6) and large amorphized (W22) water clusters as implemented in Binding Energy Evaluation protocol. A barrierless formation mechanism for CH$_{3}$CHS under low-temperature interstellar conditions is identified, in the gas phase. Surface environments modulate activation barriers in a site-specific manner, elucidated through both Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal initiated surface reaction pathways. Compared to oxygen analogs, sulfur chemistry enables alternate pathways due to weaker S-H bonding, with a competing route forming ethane-1,1-di-thiol (CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH), on the ice-grain surface, potentially reducing CH$_{3}$CHS yields. The first accurate binding energy for thioethanol on water ice is also reported, confirming its greater volatility than ethanol. The proposed mechanism offers a tentative hypothesis for the apparent mutual exclusive detections of the CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH and CH$_{3}$CHS in TMC-1, Orion, and Sgr B2(N), that further requires validation through quantitative astrochemical modeling and also to distinguish this chemical differentiation from observational sensitivity limitations. These qualitative findings highlight the multifaceted chemical behavior of sulfur-bearing organics in the interstellar medium and support CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH as promising astro-chemical targets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u661f\u9645\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u786b\u4ee3\u4e59\u919b\uff08CH3CHS\uff09\u4ece\u786b\u4ee3\u4e59\u9187\uff08CH3CH2SH\uff09\u51fa\u53d1\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6c14\u76f8\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u52bf\u5792\u53cd\u5e94\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u800c\u51b0\u8868\u9762\u53cd\u5e94\u5219\u53d7\u4f4d\u70b9\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8c03\u63a7\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u786b\u5316\u5b66\u56e0S-H\u952e\u8f83\u5f31\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u53cd\u5e94\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faCH3CH(SH)SH\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5929\u6587\u63a2\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u51b7\u5206\u5b50\u4e91\u4e2d\u542b\u786b\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u8def\u5f84\u5bf9\u63ed\u793a\u661f\u9645\u5316\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ca\u786b\u5143\u7d20\u6536\u652f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u7279\u522b\u662f\u65b0\u8fd1\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u786b\u4ee3\u4e59\u919b\uff08CH3CHS\uff09\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u4ee5\u786b\u4ee3\u4e59\u9187\u4e3a\u524d\u9a71\u4f53\u7684\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u4f34\u968f\u526f\u4ea7\u7269\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\uff08DFT\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u6a21\u62df\u6c14\u76f8\u4e0e\u5c18\u57c3\u51b0\u8868\u9762\u73af\u5883\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u7b49\uff08W6\uff09\u548c\u5927\u578b\u975e\u6676\uff08W22\uff09\u6c34\u56e2\u7c07\u6a21\u62df\u661f\u9645\u51b0\u5e54\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff08Binding Energy Evaluation protocol\uff09\uff1b\u5206\u6790Langmuir-Hinshelwood\u4e0eEley-Rideal\u4e24\u79cd\u8868\u9762\u53cd\u5e94\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u8ba4\u6c14\u76f8\u4e2dCH3CHS\u751f\u6210\u4e3a\u65e0\u52bf\u5792\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u51b0\u8868\u9762\u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u5316\u80fd\u53d7\u4f4d\u70b9\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u8def\u5f84\u751f\u6210\u4e59\u70f7-1,1-\u4e8c\u786b\u9187\uff08CH3CH(SH)SH\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u964d\u4f4eCH3CHS\u4ea7\u7387\uff1b\u9996\u6b21\u51c6\u786e\u7ed9\u51fa\u786b\u4ee3\u4e59\u9187\u5728\u6c34\u51b0\u4e0a\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u6bd4\u4e59\u9187\u66f4\u6613\u6325\u53d1\uff1b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86TMC-1\u3001Orion\u4e0eSgr B2(N)\u4e2dCH3CH2SH\u4e0eCH3CHS\u4e92\u65a5\u89c2\u6d4b\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u6210\u56e0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u786b\u4ee3\u4e59\u919b\u53ef\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u661f\u9645\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e30\u5ea6\u53d7\u51b0\u8868\u9762\u7ade\u4e89\u53cd\u5e94\u8c03\u63a7\uff1b\u786b\u5316\u5b66\u56e0S-H\u952e\u5f31\u800c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u6c27\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7269\u7684\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u7279\u6027\uff1bCH3CH(SH)SH\u662f\u503c\u5f97\u5f00\u5c55\u5929\u6587\u641c\u5bfb\u7684\u65b0\u76ee\u6807\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u7ed3\u8bba\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u91cf\u5929\u6587\u5316\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

This parameter regularizes the geometry by removing the central singularity. Focusing on wave dynamics, we analyze scalar perturbations, quasinormal modes, and greybody factors, emphasizing the role of the regularization parameter on the effective potential and the decay properties of the modes. Using WKB methods beyond the eikonal limit, we show that the presence of scalar hair modifies both the oscillation frequencies and damping rates of quasinormal modes. In particular, we demonstrate the occurrence of an anomalous decay rate for massive scalar perturbations: above a critical field mass, the longest-lived modes correspond to lower angular momentum, in contrast with the massless case. We derive analytical expressions for the critical mass and study its dependence on the scalar charge and overtone number. Furthermore, we apply the Horowitz-Hubeny method to compute the quasinormal frequencies and show that the results obtained from the WKB and Horowitz-Hubeny approaches exhibit excellent agreement in the regime where both methods are valid. In addition, we compute reflection and transmission coefficients and analyze the corresponding greybody factors, clarifying how regularity effects imprint themselves on black-hole scattering properties. Our results show that regular black holes with scalar hair exhibit distinctive dynamical signatures that can be probed through quasinormal ringing and wave propagation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7531\u5177\u6709\u6807\u91cf\u8377A\u7684\u5e7b\u5f71\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u652f\u6491\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u5e73\u76f4\u6b63\u5219\u9ed1\u6d1e\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6807\u91cf\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u51c6\u6b63\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u7070\u4f53\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6807\u91cf\u8377\u5bf9\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u4e0e\u6a21\u5f0f\u8870\u51cf\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u6b63\u5219\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff08\u65e0\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5947\u70b9\uff09\u4e2d\u6ce2\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6807\u91cf\u6bdb\u53d1\uff08scalar hair\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u533a\u5206\u6b63\u5219\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7a81\u7834\u51e0\u4f55\u5149\u5b66\u6781\u9650\u7684WKB\u65b9\u6cd5\u53caHorowitz-Hubeny\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u51c6\u6b63\u89c4\u6a21\uff1b\u89e3\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e34\u754c\u573a\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u8ba1\u7b97\u53cd\u5c04/\u900f\u5c04\u7cfb\u6570\u4e0e\u7070\u4f53\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u91cf\u6270\u52a8\u5b58\u5728\u53cd\u5e38\u8870\u51cf\u7387\uff1a\u5f53\u573a\u8d28\u91cf\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e34\u754c\u503c\u65f6\uff0c\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bff\u547d\u6700\u957f\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e34\u754c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6807\u91cf\u8377\u548c\u6cdb\u97f3\u6570\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff1bWKB\u4e0eHorowitz-Hubeny\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u7070\u4f53\u56e0\u5b50\u53cd\u6620\u6b63\u5219\u6027\u5bf9\u6563\u5c04\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5370\u8bb0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5177\u6709\u6807\u91cf\u6bdb\u53d1\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u51c6\u6b63\u89c4\u6a21\u632f\u8361\u548c\u6ce2\u4f20\u64ad\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5176\u5929\u6587\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002"}}

The H I covering fraction (k_HI) within the virial radius (Rvir) of low-mass (7 < log10(M*/Msun)< 9) galaxies, for a threshold column density of log10(N(HI)/cm^-2) = 14.5, exhibits an enhancement along both the disk plane (azimuthal angle phi < 20 degree) and in the polar direction (phi > 70 degree). In contrast, such a bimodal distribution is not observed for higher mass galaxies (9 < log10(M*/Msun) < 11.3). Similarly, the O VI covering fraction (k_OVI), for a threshold of log10(N(OVI)/cm^-2) = 14.0, shows a tentative enhancement along both the projected major and minor axes for low-mass galaxies. In contrast, O VI-bearing gas around higher- mass galaxies appears more uniformly distributed, with no significant azimuthal dependence. Finally, using the halo circular-velocity-normalized pixel-velocity two-point correlation function (TPCF), we find that O VI absorbers are kinematically narrower along the disk plane compared to the polar directions of the host galaxies with similar stellar mass distributions. The observed isotropic distribution of O VI in high-mass halos suggests that its spatial distribution is governed by global halo properties; however, the O VI kinematics retain memory of the site of origin.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86113\u4e2a\u5b64\u7acb\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u5468\u4ecb\u8d28\uff08CGM\uff09\u4e2dH I\u548cO VI\u6c14\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2dH I\u548cO VI\u8986\u76d6\u5206\u6570\u5728\u76d8\u9762\u548c\u6781\u5411\u5747\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5448\u53cc\u5cf0\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u800c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5219\u66f4\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\uff1bO VI\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4ecd\u4fdd\u7559\u8d77\u6e90\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u661f\u7cfb\u8d28\u91cf\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdCGM\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u79bb\u5b50\uff08H I\u548cO VI\uff09\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6c14\u4f53\u5438\u79ef\u3001\u5916\u6d41\u53ca\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eMUSEQuBES\u7b49\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790113\u4e2a\u7ea2\u79fb0.12<z<0.75\u5b64\u7acb\u661f\u7cfbCGM\u4e2dH I\u548cO VI\u7684\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\u8986\u76d6\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6655\u5706\u901f\u5ea6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u901f\u5ea6\u4e24\u70b9\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\uff08TPCF\uff09\u7814\u7a76O VI\u5438\u6536\u4f53\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u7cfb\uff087<log10(M*/Msun)<9\uff09\u4e2dH I\u548cO VI\u8986\u76d6\u5206\u6570\u5728\u76d8\u9762\uff08\u03c6<20\u00b0\uff09\u548c\u6781\u5411\uff08\u03c6>70\u00b0\uff09\u5747\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\uff1b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u7cfb\uff089<log10(M*/Msun)<11.3\uff09\u4e2d\u4e8c\u8005\u5747\u5448\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u5206\u5e03\uff1bO VI\u5438\u6536\u4f53\u5728\u76d8\u9762\u65b9\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u66f4\u7a84\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4fdd\u7559\u8d77\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "CGM\u4e2dH I\u548cO VI\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u53d7\u661f\u7cfb\u8d28\u91cf\u8c03\u63a7\uff1a\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u53d7\u661f\u7cfb\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7531\u5168\u5c40\u6655\u6027\u8d28\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff1b\u4f46O VI\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u59cb\u7ec8\u53cd\u6620\u5176\u8d77\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

While models of this process have advanced, they typically focus on asymptotically flat spacetimes. In this paper, we explore how the absence of asymptotic flatness affects the slow, adiabatic orbital evolution due to radiation reaction. This lack of asymptotic flatness can arise from external environments or an expanding universe. Using the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, where the deviation from flatness is governed by the cosmological constant, we study bound orbits characterized by their semi-latus rectum $p$ and eccentricity $e$. We calculate how the cosmological constant shifts the separatrix between bound and plunging orbits and alters the relationship between the binary's binding energy, angular momentum, and orbital parameters. Assuming the orbital timescale is much shorter than the inspiral timescale, we apply a modified quadrupole formula to examine the impact of a small positive cosmological constant on the orbital evolution in the weak-field limit. We find that the cosmological constant accelerates the decrease in eccentricity, reducing inspiral plunge times, which could influence event rate estimates for space-based detectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u5e73\u76f4\u65f6\u7a7a\uff08\u5982Schwarzschild-de Sitter\u65f6\u7a7a\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u81f4\u5bc6\u5929\u4f53\u7ed5\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7f13\u6162\u65cb\u8fdb\u65f6\u8f90\u5c04\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u8f68\u9053\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u5e38\u6570\u4f1a\u52a0\u901f\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u8870\u51cf\u3001\u7f29\u77ed\u65cb\u8fdb\u5e76\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff08\u5982LISA\uff09\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81f4\u5bc6\u53cc\u661f\u65cb\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e10\u8fd1\u5e73\u76f4\u65f6\u7a7a\uff0c\u4f46\u771f\u5b9e\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u73af\u5883\u6216\u5b87\u5b99\u81a8\u80c0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u5e73\u76f4\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8003\u5bdf\u5176\u5bf9\u8f90\u5c04\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Schwarzschild-de Sitter\uff08SdS\uff09\u65f6\u7a7a\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5177\u534a\u901a\u5f84p\u548c\u504f\u5fc3\u7387e\u7684\u675f\u7f1a\u8f68\u9053\uff1b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u5e38\u6570\u5bf9\u675f\u7f1a- plunging \u5206\u754c\u7ebf\uff08separatrix\uff09\u53ca\u80fd\u91cf-\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf-\u8f68\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5728\u5f31\u573a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0b\u5e94\u7528\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u56db\u6781\u77e9\u516c\u5f0f\u7814\u7a76\u5c0f\u6b63\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u5e38\u6570\u5bf9\u8f68\u9053\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u5e38\u6570\u4f7f\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u7387\u52a0\u5feb\uff0c\u675f\u7f1a\u8f68\u9053\u66f4\u5feb\u8fdb\u5165plunge\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u77ed inspiral-plunge \u65f6\u95f4\uff1b\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u5f31\u573a\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u53ef\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u5e73\u76f4\u6027\uff08\u4ee5\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u5e38\u6570\u4e3a\u4ee3\u8868\uff09\u4e0d\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u4f4e\u9891\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6e90\u7684\u957f\u671f\u8f68\u9053\u6f14\u5316\u4e0e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u9700\u7eb3\u5165\u6b64\u7c7b\u80cc\u666f\u66f2\u7387\u6548\u5e94\u3002"}}

Very little is known about the nature and origins of this population of \"Ultra-Faint Compact Satellites\" (UFCSs) owing to a dearth of spectroscopic measurements. Here, we present the first spectroscopic census of these compact systems based on Magellan/IMACS and Keck/DEIMOS observations of 19 individual UFCSs, representing $\\sim$2/3 of the known population. We securely measure mean radial velocities for all 19 systems, velocity dispersions for 15 (predominantly upper limits), metallicities for 17, metallicity dispersions for 8, and $\\textit{Gaia}$-based mean proper motions for 18. This large new spectroscopic sample provides the first insights into population-level trends for these extreme satellites. We demonstrate that: (1) the UFCSs are kinematically colder, on average, than the UFDs, disfavoring very dense dark matter halos in most cases, (2) the UFCS population is chemically diverse, spanning a factor of $\\sim$300 in mean iron abundance ($\\rm -3.3 \\lesssim [Fe/H] \\lesssim -0.8$), with multiple systems falling beneath the \"metallicity floor\" proposed for GCs, and (3) while some higher-metallicity and/or younger UFCSs are clearly star clusters, the dynamical and/or chemical evidence allows the possibility that up to $\\sim$50% of the UFCSs in our sample (9 of 19) may represent the smallest and least-massive galaxies yet discovered.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8eMagellan/IMACS\u548cKeck/DEIMOS\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5bf919\u4e2a\u8d85\u5fae\u5f31\u81f4\u5bc6\u536b\u661f\uff08UFCSs\uff09\u5f00\u5c55\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5149\u8c31\u666e\u67e5\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u5f25\u6563\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u66f4\u51b7\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u6210\u5206\u591a\u6837\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u8fc4\u4eca\u6700\u5c0f\u6700\u8f7b\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "UFCSs\u6027\u8d28\u4e0e\u8d77\u6e90\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5149\u8c31\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u672c\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Magellan/IMACS\u548cKeck/DEIMOS\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u5bf919\u4e2aUFCSs\u8fdb\u884c\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u5f25\u6563\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u5f25\u6563\u53caGaia\u89c6\u5dee\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\uff081\uff09UFCSs\u5e73\u5747\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u66f4\u51b7\uff0c\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6570\u7cfb\u7edf\u62e5\u6709\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6655\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u5316\u5b66\u6210\u5206\u8de8\u5ea6\u5927\uff08[Fe/H]\u4ece-3.3\u5230-0.8\uff09\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u4f4e\u4e8e\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u4e0b\u9650\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u7ea650%\uff089/19\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u8fc4\u4eca\u6700\u5c0f\u6700\u8f7b\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "UFCSs\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u5316\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u9ad8\u5ea6\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8fd1\u534a\u6570\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5df2\u77e5\u6700\u5c0f\u3001\u6700\u8f7b\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u661f\u7cfb\u4e0e\u661f\u56e2\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u8fb9\u754c\u3002"}}

This causes the spins to precess and leads to an asymmetric emission of gravitational waves. The resulting gravitational-wave multipole asymmetries directly source the recoil of the remnant black hole and are the critical element in fully describing precession. Recoil and precession are of significant astrophysical importance, but multipole asymmetries contribute only minimally to the overall signal strength. Consequently, most current gravitational-wave models either do not incorporate asymmetries at all, or only consider the dominant ones. Here we highlight the importance of subdominant multipole asymmetries for an accurate recoil velocity calculation and discuss their detectability with third generation detectors. Neglecting subdominant asymmetries leads to velocity differences of up to 210 km/s and can, in particular, introduce systematic biases in the inference of masses and the spin geometry. We further discuss universal characteristics of subdominant multipole asymmetries in order to prepare the ground for potential future asymmetry models. In the inspiral regime, the average antisymmetric frequencies can be described by a multiple of the orbital frequency. During ringdown, however, they become equal to their corresponding symmetric frequencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u81ea\u65cb\u4e0e\u8f68\u9053\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u4e0d\u5171\u7ebf\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u591a\u6781\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5bf9\u6b8b\u4f59\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53cd\u51b2\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6b21\u4e3b\u5bfc\u591a\u6781\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u53cd\u51b2\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u907f\u514d\u53c2\u6570\u63a8\u65ad\u7cfb\u7edf\u504f\u5dee\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7b2c\u4e09\u4ee3\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u53ca\u666e\u9002\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u6001\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u81ea\u65cb-\u8f68\u9053\u5931\u51c6\u5f15\u53d1\u81ea\u65cb\u8fdb\u52a8\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u591a\u6781\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u9a71\u52a8\u6b8b\u4f59\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53cd\u51b2\uff1b\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u591a\u5ffd\u7565\u6216\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u4e3b\u5bfc\u591a\u6781\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9020\u6210\u53cd\u51b2\u901f\u5ea6\u53ca\u53c2\u6570\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u663e\u8457\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u6b21\u4e3b\u5bfc\u591a\u6781\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5bf9\u53cd\u51b2\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 inspiral \u4e0e ringdown \u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u9891\u7387\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u5e73\u5747\u53cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u9891\u7387\u4e0e\u8f68\u9053\u9891\u7387\u7684\u500d\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\u3001ringdown \u4e2d\u53cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0e\u5bf9\u79f0\u9891\u7387\u76f8\u7b49\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u5e45\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5ffd\u7565\u6b21\u4e3b\u5bfc\u591a\u6781\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u53cd\u51b2\u901f\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\u9ad8\u8fbe210 km/s\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u81ea\u65cb\u51e0\u4f55\u53c2\u6570\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728inspiral\u9636\u6bb5\u5177\u6709\u4e0e\u8f68\u9053\u9891\u7387\u6210\u6574\u6570\u500d\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u53cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u5728ringdown\u9636\u6bb5\u5219\u4e0e\u5bf9\u5e94\u5bf9\u79f0\u9891\u7387\u76f8\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b21\u4e3b\u5bfc\u591a\u6781\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u867d\u5bf9\u6574\u4f53\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8d21\u732e\u5fae\u5c0f\uff0c\u5374\u662f\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u53cd\u51b2\u548c\u8fdb\u52a8\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff1b\u9700\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7b2c\u4e09\u4ee3\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u5bf9\u5176\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Motivated by this discrepancy, we investigate the inflationary predictions of the $\u03b2$-exponential potential, $V(\u03c6)=V_0\\left(1-\u03bb\u03b2\u03c6/M_p\\right)^{1/\u03b2}$ considering both minimally and non-minimally coupled realizations. This potential generalizes standard exponential inflation and naturally arises in braneworld scenarios. We derive analytical expressions for the slow-roll parameters and inflationary observables using a perturbative expansion in the non-minimal coupling $\u03be$, and validate these results through numerical calculations. In the minimally coupled case, the model predicts $n_s \\simeq 0.976$ and $r \\simeq 0.035$ for $N=50$ and moderate values of \u03b2, remaining compatible with ACT+DESI constraints at the 1\u03c3level while yielding a spectral tilt larger than the universal attractor prediction. Introducing a small non-minimal coupling significantly improves agreement with observations by suppressing the tensor-to-scalar ratio while preserving the enhanced scalar tilt. For $N=60, \u03bb\\sim 0.3-0.5$, and $\u03b2\\sim O(1-5)$, the non-minimally coupled model yields $n_s \\simeq 0.974-0.976$ and $r \\lesssim 0.03$, comfortably consistent with ACT, DESI, and BICEP/Keck bounds. Our results show that the $\u03b2$-exponential potential, especially when implemented with a non-minimal coupling, exhibits good agreement with the latest CMB observations.

We have considered two functional forms of f(R,L_m) and one functional form of f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Considering the matter Lagrangian L_m=p, we calculate modified TOV equations for each of the forms. By employing the fully degenerate electron gas equation of state in the modified TOV equations, we derive the mass-radius relation for each functional form of both f(R,L_m) and f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Our models imply modifications in the Chandrasekhar mass limit that deviate significantly from the GR and the Newtonian cases. In the f(R,L_m, T)$ gravity, the new mass limit of the white dwarf can reach upto 1.537\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot while in f(R,L_m) with the quadratic extension can goes upto 1.52\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot and with exponential extension upto 2.08\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot. Further, we analyze the static stability criterion, the gravitational redshift, and the adiabatic indices. For the power-law form of f(R,L_m) and the non-linear form of f(R,L_m,T) gravity, significant variations are observed at higher densities (\u03c1_c > 10^{10}\\, \\mathrm{g/cm^3}), while substantial changes are noted at much lower central densities in the case of exponential form of f(R,L_m) gravity. We also calculate compactness and gravitational redshift, which are much lower than those of neutron stars and black holes. Stability is also confirmed by adiabatic indices, which show that all models yield \u0393> 4/3 throughout the interiors of WDs.

In this work, we test the robustness of parameterized tests against unmodeled deviations from general relativity. We demonstrate that these parameterized tests are flexible and sensitive in detecting generic deviations in the waveform using the Cutler-Vallisneri bias formalism. This universality arises from examining the inherent geometry of the waveform signal and understanding how biases manifest. We show how Bayes factors are governed by the intrinsic geometry of the waveform signal manifold when parameterized tests are used to approximate generic violations of GR. We use the singular value decomposition to propose templates that are orthogonal to parameterized tests, identifying degeneracies and enhancing the detection of potential deviations. More broadly, the geometric framework developed here clarifies -- at a fundamental level -- how subtle waveform effects (including orbital eccentricity, spin precession, waveform systematics, and instrumental glitches) can mimic one another in data, and when they are intrinsically distinguishable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6ce2\u5f62\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u68c0\u9a8c\u5728\u63a2\u6d4b\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u672a\u5efa\u6a21\u504f\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\u63d0\u51fa\u6b63\u4ea4\u6a21\u677f\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u7b80\u5e76\u6027\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u504f\u5dee\u63a2\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u68c0\u9a8c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u672a\u5efa\u6a21\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u6ce2\u5f62\u6548\u5e94\uff08\u5982\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u3001\u81ea\u65cb\u8fdb\u52a8\u7b49\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u76f8\u4e92\u6a21\u4eff\u6216\u533a\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Cutler-Vallisneri\u504f\u5dee\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3b\u4e49\u548c\u6ce2\u5f62\u4fe1\u53f7\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u5185\u8574\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\u6784\u9020\u6b63\u4ea4\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u68c0\u9a8c\u7684\u6a21\u677f\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u5b9e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u68c0\u9a8c\u5177\u6709\u666e\u9002\u7075\u654f\u6027\uff1bBayes\u56e0\u5b50\u7531\u6ce2\u5f62\u4fe1\u53f7\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u5185\u8574\u51e0\u4f55\u51b3\u5b9a\uff1b\u6b63\u4ea4\u6a21\u677f\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u7b80\u5e76\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u504f\u5dee\u63a2\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u6ce2\u5f62\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u53f7\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u68c0\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Starting from accelerating Bertotti--Robinson black holes, we employ two independent mechanisms: a Melvin--Bonnor-type magnetization and an Inversion symmetry of the Einstein--Maxwell system. In both cases the external electromagnetic field can be removed, while a non-trivial gravitational backreaction remains in the metric, yielding new accelerating vacuum spacetimes of Petrov type I. In the static, non-accelerating limit, the magnetized Schwarzschild case reproduces previously known results, whereas the Inversion symmetry leads to a genuinely new vacuum configuration. These findings provide a method for generating algebraically general vacuum geometries and illustrate how electromagnetic embeddings can produce non-trivial vacuum metrics in General Relativity. The main geometrical properties of these spacetimes are discussed. Two additional results are presented in the appendices: a stationary generalization of these vacuum geometries, and two further static vacuum configurations obtained through the same symmetries but using the Alekseev--Garc\u00eda black hole as the seed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7535\u771f\u7a7a\u6784\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u5916\u90e8\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u4e2d\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u65b9\u7a0b\u771f\u7a7a\u89e3\uff1b\u5229\u7528Melvin-Bonnor\u578b\u78c1\u5316\u548cEinstein-Maxwell\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53cd\u6f14\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u52a0\u901f\u7684Bertotti-Robinson\u9ed1\u6d1e\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4ee3\u6570\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u771f\u7a7a\u65f6\u7a7a\uff08Petrov I\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9759\u6001\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u65b0\u771f\u7a7a\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u78c1\u5d4c\u5165\u751f\u6210\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7684\u771f\u7a7a\u65f6\u7a7a\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4ee3\u6570\u4e00\u822c\uff08\u975e\u4ee3\u6570\u7279\u6b8a\uff09\u771f\u7a7a\u89e3\u7684\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a0\u901fBertotti-Robinson\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff0c\u5e94\u7528Melvin-Bonnor\u578b\u78c1\u5316\u4e0eEinstein-Maxwell\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684Inversion\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e24\u79cd\u72ec\u7acb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5Alekssev-Garc\u00eda\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u79cd\u5b50\u89e3\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u5e7f\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4e24\u7c7b\u65b0\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u771f\u7a7a\u65f6\u7a7a\uff08Petrov I\u578b\uff09\uff1b\u9759\u6001\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\uff0c\u78c1\u5316Schwarzschild\u89e3\u590d\u73b0\u5df2\u6709\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u800cInversion\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5bfc\u51fa\u5168\u65b0\u771f\u7a7a\u89e3\uff1b\u9644\u5f55\u4e2d\u8fd8\u7ed9\u51fa\u5176\u5b9a\u6001\u63a8\u5e7f\u53ca\u53e6\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eAlekseev-Garc\u00eda\u79cd\u5b50\u7684\u9759\u6001\u771f\u7a7a\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7535\u78c1\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u8bf1\u5bfc\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u5f15\u529b\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u6570\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u771f\u7a7a\u51e0\u4f55\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6784\u9020\u590d\u6742\u771f\u7a7a\u65f6\u7a7a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u7535\u78c1-\u5f15\u529b\u8026\u5408\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}
