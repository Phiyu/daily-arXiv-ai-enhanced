Unraveling the Dual Impact of Bars on Star Formation in Paired Galaxies Using DESI", "comment": null, "summary": "We present a comprehensive investigation into the influence of stellar bars\non star formation (SF) in galaxy pairs, using a large sample of low-redshift\ngalaxies ($0.02$\\,$<$\\,z\\,$<$\\,$0.08$) from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys\nDR8. Our analysis examines whether bars enhance or suppress SF during pair\ninteractions, and how these outcomes depend on the star-forming properties of\ncompanion galaxies. We find that bars either catalyze or inhibit SF in their\nhost galaxies, depending on the companion's SF activity. In particular, barred\ngalaxies paired with actively star-forming companions experience more\npronounced central starbursts (with sSFR up to $\\sim$\\,2.5 dex higher) than\nunbarred counterparts, whereas those with passive companions often have\nsuppressed SF (sometimes below isolated galaxy levels). The notion of the dual\nrole of bars can reconcile conventional conflicting reports of bar-driven\nenhancement versus quenching of SF activity. Bars, well known to regulate\nkpc-scale dynamics, may also link to the impact of external environments: when\na star-forming companion provides sufficient gas, bars drive central\nstarbursts, whereas in gas-poor interactions, bars hasten gas depletion and\ncontribute to SF suppression. This work highlights the necessity of accounting\nfor both internal structure and companion properties to fully understand SF\nregulation in interacting galaxies."}

In this work, we\nfirst find that all three types of critical points appear in quantum anomalous\nblack holes for 4D spacetime. We then compute the quasinormal modes of massless\nscalar perturbations near these critical points and find that both the\noscillation frequency and damping rate increase with the black hole radius at\nthe critical temperature. Besides such common behavior, although the Q = +1 and\nQ = 0 cases do not show a discernible pattern due to the limited number of\nsamples, the Q = -1 case exhibits very similar dynamical characteristics across\nall three black hole solutions, implying a nontrivial connection between\ntopological thermodynamics and dynamics."}

Then, we\nderive its accretion rate and seed mass, and for comparison of three other\nsimilar-size (~1-2E+10 solar masses) black holes at various redshifts, using\nwell-tested empirical scaling relations. The results indicate that J0529-4351\ngrew from a heavy seed (~2-3E+04 solar masses), and that its accretion rate\n(~10-13 solar masses/year) is the lowest of the four black holes. However, its\nradiative efficiency inferred from its bolometric luminosity and the derived\naccretion rate is the highest, which explains why it is the most luminous\ndespite having the lowest accretion rate. This study challenges the prevailing\nnotion that a higher luminosity or a higher Eddington ratio implies a higher\naccretion rate, highlights the dependence of a black hole's luminosity on\nradiative efficiency, reveals the pitfalls of inferring black hole properties\nassuming a standard value for radiative efficiency, and suggests that the\nEddington ratios of high-luminosity BHs may be significantly overestimated."}

Despite their\npotential astrophysical relevance, the stability of these configurations\n-naturally expected to form through superradiant growth of light bosonic\nfields- remains uncertain. In this work, we investigate the stability of RHBHs\nby performing fully non-linear numerical evolutions of several configurations\nthat differ in the relative mass contribution of the scalar-field torus. We\nfind that configurations in which the scalar field mass is subdominant compared\nto the black hole mass remain stable throughout the evolution. In contrast,\nwhen the scalar-field mass dominates, the system develops an instability akin\nto the non-axisymmetric instability observed in rotating boson stars. Given the\nexpected limits on the scalar-field mass growth achievable through\nsuperradiance, our results suggest that rotating hairy black holes formed\npredominantly by this process are expected to be stable."}

Within the core sample, we highlight the first discovery of\na UDG pair. Their projected separation is just 75 arcsec (22 kpc at 61.9 Mpc),\nwith a central H I velocity difference of 34 km s$^{-1}$. The North-Western UDG\n(WALLABY J104513-262755-UDG-1) has a larger H I reservoir,\n$\\log_{10}(M_{HI}/\\rm M_{\\odot}) = 8.95\\pm0.03$, compared to the South-Eastern\nUDG (WALLABY J104513-262755-UDG-2), $\\log_{10}(M_{HI}/\\rm M_{\\odot}) =\n8.60\\pm0.04$.

We focus particularly on viewing angle\neffects. Our mock observations revealed that the smallest line broadening,\nobserved as velocity dispersion, associated with the cocoon's bulk expansion\noccurs when observing along the jet direction, where the expansion velocity is\nhighest. Although this may appear counterintuitive, it occurs because the\nrapidly expanding jet head contributes little to X-ray emission due to its high\ntemperature and low density.

To assess robustness, we include simulations\nwith differing feedback models and galaxy properties. Combining gas and stellar\nmaps reduces the dispersion in the inferred mass profiles by up to a factor of\n$\\sim$1.5 compared to models using either tracer independently.
