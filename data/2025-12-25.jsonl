In this study and for the first time, we assess the performance of various network configurations using neural posterior estimation (NPE) implemented in Dingo-IS-a method based on normalizing flows and importance sampling that enables fast and accurate inference. We focus on a specific science case involving short-duration, massive and high-redshift binary black hole (BBH) mergers with detector-frame chirp masses $M_{\\mathrm{d}} > 100$ M$_\\odot$. These systems encompass early-Universe stellar and primordial black holes, as well as intermediate-mass black-hole binaries, for which XG observatories are expected to deliver major discoveries. Validation against standard Bayesian inference demonstrates that NPE robustly reproduces complex and disconnected posterior structures across all network configurations. For a network of two misaligned L-shaped ET detectors (2L MisA), the posterior distributions on luminosity distance can become multimodal and degenerate with the sky position, leading to less precise distance estimates compared to the triangular ET configuration. However, the number of sky-location multimodalities is substantially lower than the eight expected with the triangular ET, resulting in improved sky and volume localization. Adding CE to the network further reduces sky-position degeneracies, and the better performance of the 2L MisA configuration over the triangle remains evident."}

In four-dimensional spacetime the trace-adjusted Einstein and Ricci tensors are identical, and their unadjusted traces are oppositely signed yet equal in absolute value. This allows us to express these Ricci invariants using Einstein's curvature tensor, facilitating a direct interpretation of the energy-momentum tensor. We present detailed plots illustrating the distribution of these invariants. Our findings underscore the requirement for four distinct layers of an anisotropic stress-energy tensor to create the warp bubble. Additionally, we delve into the Kretschmann quadratic invariant decomposition. We provide a critical analysis of the work by Mattingly et al., particularly their underrepresentation of curvature invariants in their plots by 8 to 16 orders of magnitude. A comparison is made between the spacetime curvature of the Alcubierre warp-drive and that of a Schwarzschild black hole with a mass equivalent to the planet Saturn.

This preference is not sensitive to our choice of prior, but it is contingent on the inclusion of supernovae in the analysis. We comment on the consistency between various information criteria and Bayesian evidence ratios, finding that the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) tracks the Bayesian evidence more reliably than either the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).

Despite the extensive study of $f(R,T)$ gravity, the asymptotic implications of quadratic trace couplings in scalar field cosmology remain largely unexplored. We focus on a specific form given by $ f(R,T^φ) = R + αT^φ+ β(T^φ)^2/2$, in which the parameters $α$ and $β$ control the strength of non-minimal couplings between geometry and matter. We derive the set of cosmological equations for a spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic universe and construct the autonomous system of first-order differential equations using a compact set of dimensionless variables. This formulation provides a foundation for the qualitative analysis of the asymptotic behavior. We identify and classify all critical points and analyze their stability properties. Finally, the energy conditions and the presence of dynamical instabilities are examined. We study the general scenario $α\\neq 0$ and $β\\neq 0$, along with the subcases $α= 0$ and $β= 0$, in order to compare with minimally coupled quintessence $α= β= 0$. We find that the quadratic term in $T^φ$ admits late-time accelerated de Sitter-like critical solutions at the background level. However, several accelerated points lie in a degenerate scalar sector with $Q_s=0$, where the standard linear perturbation criteria are inconclusive, while the quasi-de Sitter point with $Q_s>0$ is of saddle type. Therefore, establishing full perturbative viability requires going beyond the linear analysis in the degenerate sector."}

Studies have found an intriguing correlation between standardized Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) luminosities and host galaxy masses, commonly referred to as the \"mass step\". SNe Ia in massive galaxies appear systematically brighter than in lower-mass, star-forming hosts after standardization. However, previous analyses use host galaxy mass estimates derived largely from optical data alone and assume parametric forms for host star formation histories (SFHs), both of which are known to misestimate galaxy stellar masses. In this work, we re-examine the mass-step relation with a sample of SN Ia host galaxies complete in broadband optical (3000 Angstrom to 1 micron) and near-infrared (up to 1.8 micron) data, and in some cases including mid-infrared observations (up to 4.5 micron), using Prospector to derive nonparametric SFHs. We find that while the masses for these galaxies have indeed been underestimated, the overall trend in SN Ia luminosity versus host mass remains largely unchanged. We also uncover an environmental metallicity-dependent trend, in which low-metallicity galaxies (Z < -1 Zsol) may drive much of the observed SN Ia luminosity-mass correlation, suggesting that the chemical composition of the SN environment plays a central role in shaping the standardized brightness of SNe Ia."}

They play extremely important roles in black hole shadows, gravitational lensings, quasi-normal modes, and spacetime topological properties. The development of analytical methods for these circular orbits has also drawn extensive attention. In our recent work, \\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.L021501}{Phys. Rev. D \\textbf{106}, L021501 (2022)}, a geometric approach to circular photon orbits was proposed for spherically symmetric spacetimes. In the present study, we give an extension of this geometric approach from spherically symmetric spacetimes to axially symmetric rotational spacetimes. In such a geometric approach, light rings in the equatorial plane are determined through the intrinsic curvatures in the optical geometry of Lorentz spacetime, which gives rise to a Randers-Finsler geometry for axially symmetric spacetimes. Specifically, light rings can be precisely determined by the condition of vanishing geodesic curvature, and the stability of light rings is classified through the intrinsic flag curvature in Randers-Finsler optical geometry. This geometric approach presented in this work is generally applicable to any stationary and axially symmetric spacetime, without imposing any restriction on the spacetime metric forms. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous demonstration to show that our geometric approach yields completely equivalent results with those derived from the conventional approach (based on the effective potential of photons)."}

By combining internal kinematical properties and environmental diagnostics, we find that barred galaxies are more frequently associated with centrally concentrated stellar mass distributions (within 1 and 2 effective radii) and exhibit lower values of the stellar angular momentum $λ_{Re}$. At fixed total stellar mass, barred galaxies exhibit: (i) higher stellar mass, and (ii) lower angular momentum, both in their inner regions than their unbarred counterparts. We find a bimodal dependence of the bar fraction on tidal interactions produced by the nearest neighbour. Specifically, the bar fraction peaks in the most isolated galaxies, where bars form unequivocally through internal secular processes, decreases at intermediate interaction strengths, and rises again in the strong interaction regime, likely reflecting the role of dense environments in sustaining or triggering bars. Our results suggest that internal gravitational instabilities are the primary driver of bar formation. External tidal perturbations play a secondary role, capable of triggering or enhancing bar formation in galaxies that are already internally predisposed. Our findings provide robust observational validation of theoretical bar formation and evolution models in galaxies."}

We present a novel accretion disc-based sub-grid model for BH mass and spin evolution in the super-Eddington regime, implemented in the hydrodynamics code GIZMO. In our model, motivated by results of radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of accretion discs, the growth of the BH is mediated by a sub-grid accretion disc, comprising an inner photon-trapping region described by simulation-based fitting formulae and an outer thin $α$-disc with three regions. We incorporate a self-consistent spin evolution prescription that transitions between the Bardeen-Petterson effect and inner thick-disc precession, depending on the accretion rate. We perform a suite of idealised simulations of a BH embedded in a gaseous circumnuclear disc and a spherically distributed stellar component to explore the conditions under which super-Eddington accretion can be sustained in the environment of a realistic galactic nucleus. Simulations with misaligned gas inflows onto an initially aligned BH-disc system yield very high Eddington ratios, triggered by the rapid removal of disc angular momentum via inflows. These results highlight the importance of angular momentum misalignment in enabling super-Eddington accretion and suggest that such episodes are difficult to trigger unless the system resides in a highly dynamical environment -- a condition more likely to occur in high-redshift galaxies. Our model potentially provides a way to grow moderate-mass BH seeds to the sizes required to explain the bright high-redshift quasars."}

By identifying the entropies of subsystems to those of qubits, we successfully constructed the reduced density matrices of the two subsystems as well as the density matrix for the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole, modelled as 2-correlating qubits. Moreover, our results suggested that when the gravitational effect has its role in the qubit systems, supposedly like black holes, the correlation between qubits are constrained with a lower bound more stringent than the so-called Araki-Lieb triangle inequality."}

Fully general-relativistic, spherically symmetric simulations are used to extract nonperturbative sound-shell profiles from isolated curvature peaks; these profiles are then embedded into three-dimensional lattice evolutions of relativistic hydrodynamics coupled to transverse-traceless metric perturbations to compute the acoustic GW spectra. The acoustic signal has a peak frequency determined by the comoving shell thickness, and its amplitude is extremely sensitive to the mean comoving separation of peaks, scaling approximately as $R_{*c}^{-7}$. We find a robust causal low-frequency tail $\\propto k^{3}$, and the nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions can enhance the ultraviolet power. Comparing with SIGWs computed perturbatively from the same real-space configuration, we show that acoustic GWs can be amplified by an order of magnitude and display a peak shifted to a lower frequency in the large-amplitude regime.

The fluctuations of the geometry for a Bell-network state are entangled, similar to those in the semiclassical limit as described by quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. We present a comprehensive analysis of the effective geometry of Bell-network states on a dipole graph. This analysis provides a detailed characterization of the quantum geometry of a class of diffeomorphism-invariant, area-law states representing homogeneous and isotropic configurations in loop quantum gravity, which may be explored as boundary states for the dynamics of the theory."}

We develop a hybrid numerical framework to signify nonperturbative effects on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background sourced by primordial curvature perturbations, focusing on the acoustic channel (fluid motions). Fully general-relativistic, spherically symmetric simulations are used to extract nonperturbative sound-shell profiles from isolated curvature peaks; these profiles are then embedded into three-dimensional lattice evolutions of relativistic hydrodynamics coupled to transverse-traceless metric perturbations to compute the acoustic GW spectra. The acoustic signal has a peak frequency determined by the comoving shell thickness, and its amplitude is extremely sensitive to the mean comoving separation of peaks, scaling approximately as $R_{*c}^{-7}$. We find a robust causal low-frequency tail $\\propto k^{3}$, and the nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions can enhance the ultraviolet power. Comparing with SIGWs computed perturbatively from the same real-space configuration, we show that acoustic GWs can be amplified by an order of magnitude and display a peak shifted to a lower frequency in the large-amplitude regime.

By classifying these spacetimes into three fundamental types, Type I (Kretschmann scalar K_max increasing with mass M), Type II (mass-independent K_max), and Type III (K_max decreasing with M), we demonstrate how subtle variations in the core geometry imprint distinguishable features on the BH shadow. A detailed analysis of photon dynamics reveals that the parameters α and n, which control the deviation from Schwarzschild geometry and the radial decay of the regularizing factor, respectively, systematically alter the properties of the photon sphere. These intrinsic geometric differences propagate outward: for fixed parameters, Type III BHs, with the most compact photon sphere, produce the smallest and brightest shadows, whereas Type I BHs yield the largest and dimmest ones. Shadow computations under both static and infalling spherical accretion models confirm that the curvature-based classification directly corresponds to observable differences. Critically, Type III BHs exhibit the strongest sensitivity to parameter variations, making them optimal probes for constraining the underlying spacetime geometry. Our work reveals that even among nonsingular BHs sharing the same asymptotic core, differences in internal curvature are reflected in the shadow morphology, thereby providing a new pathway to test quantum-gravity-inspired models using upcoming high-resolution observations."}

The waveform modification is derived by incorporating the scalar charge correcting the fluxes and orbital trajectories of the secondary. Our results indicate that, under suitable parameter configurations, the influence of the scalar charge on EMRIs waveform in such environments can be distinguished from that in vacuum spacetime. For the EMRIs signal modified by the astrophysical environments, the future space-borne detector can determine the relative error of scalar charge constrained by LISA at the level of $\\sim0.1$, providing a preliminary prediction of detecting scalar charge in the beyond-vacuum spacetime."}

We find that thawing quintessence is consistently preferred over a cosmological constant when combining BAO data from DESI DR2 and CMB data from Planck+ACT with any of the major supernova compilations, including the recently updated DES-Dovekie sample. This preference is not sensitive to our choice of prior, but it is contingent on the inclusion of supernovae in the analysis. We comment on the consistency between various information criteria and Bayesian evidence ratios, finding that the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) tracks the Bayesian evidence more reliably than either the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Finally, we use observational likelihoods to identify which thawing trajectories are compatible with the available data, independently of theoretical priors."}
