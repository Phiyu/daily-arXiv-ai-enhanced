While Bayesian studies of NS observations are well established in General Relativity and curvature based modified gravity theories, such analyses in $f(Q)$ gravity remain largely unexplored. We perform a Bayesian inference analysis by confronting theoretical NS mass-radius predictions with NICER observations of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0437+4715, and PSR J0614+3329. The dense matter equation of state is fixed to DDME2 in order to isolate the effects of modified gravity on NS structure. Our results show that the exponential $f(Q)$ model is statistically preferred over the linear and logarithmic cases, as confirmed by Bayes factor comparisons, and exhibits well-constrained. For this model, we obtain a radius and tidal deformability at $1.4\\,M_\\odot$ of $R_{1.4} = 11.27^{+0.53}_{-0.36}\\,\\mathrm{km}$ and $Λ_{1.4} = 156.95^{+84.02}_{-41.73}$, respectively, consistent with current observational constraints.

This new parameter represents the intensity of an external gravitational field, which can be considered the hyperbolic generalisation of the Witten's bubble of nothing. No curvature or conical singularities are present outside the event horizon. The no hair arguments are circumvented because the metric is not asymptotically flat, and neither the black hole is spherical. The gravitational hair continuously deforms the Schwarzschild geometry: the horizon becomes oblate, while its area is reduced. Conserved charges and thermodynamic properties of the black hole are studied."}

Precision tests of the weak equivalence principle achieve remarkable sensitivity but deliberately minimize electric charge on test masses, leaving this fundamental question experimentally open. We present a minimalist framework coupling electromagnetism to linearized gravity through conservation of a complex charge-mass current, predicting charge-dependent violations $Δa/g = κ(q/m)$. Remarkably, this prediction occupies unexplored experimental territory precisely because precision gravity tests avoid charge variation. We identify this as a significant gap and propose a modified torsion balance experiment where $q/m$ is treated as a controlled variable. Such an experiment could test whether gravitational acceleration depends on electric charge, probing physics in genuinely new parameter space. This work exemplifies how theoretical minimalism can reveal overlooked opportunities in fundamental physics."}

By applying the UPMASK algorithm to Gaia astrometric data for the estimation of cluster membership probabilities, it has been determined that 808 stars in NGC 869 and 707 stars in NGC 884 exhibit the highest statistical likelihood of being cluster members. The fundamental astrophysical parameters of the clusters were inferred within a Bayesian framework using Gaia data and PARSEC stellar evolutionary isochrones, through the application of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. The estimated parameters are: colour excess E(B-V) = 0.516 +0.17/-0.24 mag and 0.516 +0.22/-0.33 mag, distances 2376 +301/-278 and 2273 +230/-290 pc, ages log(t/yr) = 7.31 +0.17/-0.32 and log(t/yr) = 7.30 +0.13/-0.29, and metallicities [Fe/H] = -0.24 +/- 0.12 and [Fe/H] = -0.25 +/- 0.12 dex for NGC 869 and NGC 884, respectively. Since spectroscopic observations are not available for the clusters, SED analysis was employed for the member stars, yielding results consistent with those obtained using the MCMC method. Kinematic and Galactic orbital analyses suggest that the open clusters originated in nearby regions of the Galaxy. This interpretation is supported by their similar space velocities and Galactic orbital parameters. Furthermore, orbital integration over 1 Gyr indicates a potential interaction between the clusters within the next 11 Myr. This study provides strong evidence of a common origin and a possible future dynamical interaction, contributing valuable insights into the formation and evolution of binary open clusters in the Milky Way."}

Theoretical models suggest that the Moon could act as a resonant detector, but the unknown influence of its rugged surface and heterogeneous interior has cast doubt on this prospect. Here, we resolve this long-standing uncertainty by constructing the first high-resolution, structurally realistic model of the lunar GW response. We achieve this by combining high-fidelity spectral-element simulations with the analytical power of normal-mode perturbation theory, thereby resolving topographical effects down to $3.7$ km grid spacing while maintaining the capacity to discern global free-oscillation patterns. This dual-methodology approach not only recovers the expected predominant quadrupole ($l=2$) oscillation mode, but also exposes a systematic signal amplification of $(10-20)\\%$ in thick-crust regions. This enhancement is traced by our normal-mode analysis to a mode-coupling process, in which the original quadrupolar oscillation induced by the passing GWs distributes energy into a series of higher-order modes, the hybridized eigenmodes of the laterally heterogeneous Moon. Near certain eigen-frequencies and at specific locations, we observe up to tenfold amplification, highlighting the power of numerical simulations in resolving these structurally fine-tuned features. Our work establishes the Moon as an accurately calibrated resonant GW detector, and the resulting amplification maps provide quantitative guide for the optimal landing site selection."}

The majority of the systems (~60%) is observed in the very deep NIRCam observations of the cluster AbellS1063 (GLIMPSE program), showing the power that deep observations, combined with lensing, has to reveal these primordial stellar structures. We perform simultaneous size-flux estimates in all available NIRCam filters and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analysis to recover star cluster physical properties. All star cluster candidates have very high magnification. Star clusters and clumps show similar ages and redshift distributions, although noticeable differences are seen in their masses, sizes and stellar surface densities inherent to the lack of resolution in the latter group. We reconstruct the formation redshift of star clusters and find that the large majority of the observed star clusters show young ages (<100 Myr) and seems to form at cosmic noon (CN,1<z<4). A small sample of CN star clusters is about 1 Gyr old, these potential globular clusters have formed well within cosmic reionization. Star clusters have stellar densities in the range 10^2 to 10^6 M/pc^2, with median values around 10^4 pc2. Their sizes and densities better overlap with those of nuclear star clusters in the local Universe. These intrinsic properties make high-z star clusters a viable channel to grow intermediate mass black holes. We use Bayesian inference to make first direct measurement of the star cluster mass function at z>1, based on a subsample of 60 star clusters younger than 100 Myr and with masses above 2e6 Msun. The star cluster mass function is well described by a power-law with slope beta = -1.89 suggesting that a power-law -2 function might already be in place in the distant Universe."}

In the weak field limit, we report a leading-order correction to the deflection angle directly attributed to the non-local nature of the theory. In the strong field limit, we find that the lensing corrections are almost linearly dependent on the coupling parameter $ζ$ while being exponentially suppressed by the exponent parameter $n$.

We build population-level toy models using \\texttt{fsps} to help interpret our observations, and find that scatter in \\rline\\ primarily reflects the amplitude of SFH fluctuations; this implies that our observed lack of evolution in the scatter of \\rline\\ is due to similar star formation burstiness from $z\\sim3$ to $z\\sim7$. Our observations are best reproduced by a set of SFHs with rising, long-duration, and large-amplitude bursts.

The core of the approach is local: dot-product relations in the equatorial curved geometry relate the conserved light-deflection parameter to the observed detector angle at finite distance, providing a connection between sky positions and photon constants of motion. These local identities feed a closed model for the frequency shift of photons traveling between a maser clump circularly orbiting a black hole and a finite-distance detector, making explicit the dependence on the metric at emission and detection radii.\n  We also apply the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to this construction on the equatorial two-manifold as an intrinsic cross-check. This theorem provides a global consistency relation between the local emission and detection angles, helping to validate sign conventions and angle branch choices in the local setup. In this sense, the local and global perspectives on the megamaser system support each other.\n  To supplement the instantaneous information contained in frequency shifts, we incorporate the time-domain general relativistic invariant, the redshift rapidity. We further introduce a prospective angular-domain observable, the angular redshift rate, and give its analytic expression in the SSS framework. The results are formulated for generic SSS backgrounds, providing closed relations suited for likelihood-based inference from VLBI positions and spectral monitoring. In particular, for a Schwarzschild background, the black hole mass, its distance to Earth and megamaser orbital radius are fully constrained in the language of astrophysical observables."}

Using the semi-tetrad covariant formalism, we derive the dynamics of the collapsing fluid, including a master equation for the evolution of the Weyl curvature, to examine the role of viscosity. The analysis of null geodesic geometry uncovers a novel curvature-balance mechanism between Ricci (matter) and Weyl (free gravitational field) curvature on the apparent horizon; this balance determines the causal nature of the horizon and thereby governs the visibility of the singularity. We then derive necessary and sufficient covariant conditions for the central singularity to be locally naked. Our findings support a weaker form of cosmic censorship and extend the covariant censorship analysis to realistic dissipative, viscous collapse."}

This discrepancy may be due to observational biases in bar detectability when comparing simulations with observations. We present a proof-of-concept study quantifying how Euclid-like observational conditions affect bar detectability in TNG50. We analysed the entire galaxy sample at $z = 0.5$ and highlight one borderline case with a bar length of 2.1 kpc and bar strength $A_2 = 0.4$. Synthetic images were produced with Monte Carlo radiative transfer and realistic post-processing, and analysed with ellipse fitting and Fourier decomposition, as well as the recently constructed Zoobot analysis. Results were compared to idealised, noise-free stellar mass maps. In the illustrative case the bar is clearly detected in the mass map and remains visible in the Euclid VIS $I_{\\rm E}$ filter, where Zoobot also classifies it as barred, but becomes undetectable in $Y_{\\rm E}$ and in the VIS-NISP RGB composite, with all methods failing outside VIS. Extending to the full $z = 0.5$ sample, Zoobot recovers only 31/141 galaxies, while $A_2$ and ellipse fitting perform better (80/141 and 67/141) but still miss many short or weak bars. When non-detections are counted as unbarred, the bar fraction of 44 percent falls to $12\\!-\\!33$ percent depending on the method. These results demonstrate the strong impact of observational effects on bar detectability and motivate bar-fraction estimates which incorporate realistic instrumental conditions across redshift in cosmological simulations."}

In analogy to what occurs in the case of a homogeneous medium, there exist a family of solutions that satisfy the boundary conditions. A shooting method is employed to isolate those solutions that fulfill a specific set of physical and mathematical constraints. The tail is found to be both densest and slowest when the scaleheight $H$ is equal to the gravitational radius $ξ_{0}\\equiv GM/v_{0}^{2}$, where $v_{0}$ its relative velocity with respect to the medium. The location of the stagnation point is evaluated as a function of $H$ and $ξ_{0}$, and an empirical fitting formula is provided.

When instead the midplane density is held constant and $H$ is varied, the accretion rate hardly changes once $H$ exceeds about $2ξ_{0}$. Additionally, we investigate how both the drag force resulting from mass accretion and the gravitational drag arising from its tail depend on $H/ξ_{0}$. We highlight how the effect of varying the degree of mixing in the tail influences the resulting drag force.

We show that potential deformations of this type leave the (reduced) Dirac algebra unchanged and the modification is naturally reinterpreted as an effective anisotropic stress energy contribution. While the fluid reproduces an isothermal-like mass scaling, its pressure anisotropy prevents it from giving flat rotation curves. We then turn to HL gravity, where the deformed Dirac algebra induces a controlled nonconservation law for an emergent dust component. Generalizing earlier results, we identify a restricted class of LTB backgrounds for which the HL source term yields a positive scaling dark matter density, consistent with ghost-freedom, and recovery of GR in the infrared.

We selected a sample consisting of JO201 and JW100, undergoing ram-pressure stripping, and NGC 5291 and NGC 7252, formed through gravitational interactions, to investigate how different perturbation mechanisms influence dust content and star formation in extragalactic features. In both cases, star formation can be observed outside the main disks of the galaxies. We present new results of dust attenuation for JO201 and JW100, while for NGC 5291 and NGC 7252 we use results from our previous study, based on high-resolution observations obtained with the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope onboard AstroSat. Dust attenuation is determined from the ultraviolet continuum slope ($β$) calculated using the FUV-NUV colour, and the star formation rates of the star-forming knots are corrected accordingly. It is seen that dust attenuation and dust-corrected SFR densities of the knots in the ram-pressure stripped tails of JO201 and JW100 are comparable to those in the collisional ring of the NGC 5291 system and the tidal tails of the NGC 7252 system. We conclude that, though the formation scenarios of the tails of JO201 and JW100, the NGC 5291 ring, and the NGC 7252 tails are different, their dust content and star formation activity are notably similar."}

Submitted to MNRAS. Comments are welcome", "summary": "Tomographic reconstruction of reionization is a long-sought goal. It would move the field beyond global summary statistics, such as the volume-averaged ionised fraction, to direct, field-level constraints on the ionization topology. With this in mind, we present TORRCH (TOmographic Reconstruction of the Reionization of Cosmic Hydrogen), a deep-learning framework that reconstructs the neutral-hydrogen fraction field during the epoch of reionization from the spatial distributions of Ly$α$ emitters (LAEs) and non-Ly$α$-selected galaxies (NLSGs) at luminosity limits comparable to current surveys. Using hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with radiative transfer, we train a deterministic 3D U-Net on mock surveys spanning diverse reionization scenarios and predict the neutral-fraction field. We find that TORRCH recovers the large-scale ionization morphology from synthetic data comparable to current surveys with high fidelity, and reproduces both the one-point distribution and the 2D power spectrum of projected neutral fractions. The predicted galaxy-IGM cross-correlation is also captured well, including the expected small-scale anti-correlation and its decline towards zero at large separations. Reconstruction quality depends on tracer completeness, with deep joint LAE+NLSG samples yielding the most accurate morphology, while LAE-only selections retain bubble-scale topology but with reduced fidelity. Robustness tests show that the method is stable to variations in ionization conditions between training and test data, and to realistic redshift uncertainties. Our results suggest that galaxy-based tomography can potentially deliver reliable reionization maps across realistic survey redshift windows."}

We begin by revisiting the Chamblin et al. black string, highlighting its role as a foundational higher-dimensional solution. We then show that the Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole can be consistently embedded in this framework via a localized free scalar field, providing a simple yet nontrivial example of a braneworld compact object. Finally, we derive two novel black string solutions sourced by a localized nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) theory with Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{F}) = -β\\sqrt{\\mathcal{F}}$, corresponding to purely magnetic and dyonic configurations. The purely magnetic solution reproduces the classical Letelier string cloud on the brane, while the dyonic solution generalizes it to include electric charge, closely paralleling the Letelier-Alencar construction. Both NED solutions reduce smoothly to the Chamblin et al. black string in the limit $β\\to 0$, illustrating how localized higher-dimensional matter fields can consistently support braneworld compact objects and connect higher-dimensional physics with well-known four-dimensional solutions."}

However, direct evidence for a hot (million-Kelvin) CGM around present-day L* galaxies remains elusive. Here, we present the first systematic search of the hot CGM around nearby (< 50 Mpc) L* galaxies, by stacking their X-ray images and spectra from the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey. Significant diffuse X-ray emission is detected out to ~ 50 kpc, with spectral signatures consistent with a hot gas but arguing against a predominantly non-thermal origin. The radial distribution and total amount of the hot gas are in agreement with prediction by IllustrisTNG simulations. The constraints on the hot CGM derived in this study hold promise for calibrating key physical processes in next-generation cosmological simulations."}

This includes radial velocity measurements ($\\sim$16,000) and iron abundances ($Δ$S method for 8,140 RRLs, plus 547 from literature). Elemental abundances based on high-resolution spectra are provided for 487 RRLs and 64 BHB stars. We identified candidate RRLs associated to the main Galactic components and their iron distribution function (IDF) becomes more metal-rich when moving from the Halo ([Fe/H]=-1.56) to the Thick (TCD; [Fe/H]=-1.47) and Thin (TND; [Fe/H]=-0.73) disk. Furthermore, Halo RRLs and RRLs in retrograde orbits are $α$-enhanced ([$α$/Fe]=0.27, $σ$=0.18), while TCD RRLs are either $α$-enhanced ([Fe/H]$\\le$-1.0) or $α$-poor ([Fe/H]$>$-1.0), and TND RRLs are mainly $α$-poor ([$α$/Fe]=-0.01, $σ$=0.20). We also identified RRLs associated to the main stellar streams (Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus [GSE]; Sequoia, Helmi, Sagittarius) and we found that their IDFs are quite similar to Halo RRLs. However, GSE RRLs lack the metal-poor/metal-rich tails and their $α$-element distribution is quite compact. The iron radial gradient in Galactocentric distance for TND, TCD and Halo RRLs is negative and it decreases from -0.026, to -0.010, and to -0.002 dex/kpc. The iron radial gradient based on dry Halo (Halo without substructures) RRLs is, within the errors, equal to the global Halo. We also found a strong similarity between iron and [$α$/Fe] radial gradients of Milky Way RRLs and M31 globular clusters throughout the full range of galactocentric distances covered by the two samples."}

Both trace cosmic-ray electrons in the intracluster medium, though recent observations suggest their distinction is not always clear. We present new 903-1655 MHz MeerKAT observations of Abell 1775 and Abell 1795, both hosting cool cores and cold fronts. Combined with reprocessed 120-168 MHz LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey data, we perform imaging and spectral analyses of their radio emission. In both clusters, we detect radio haloes with distinct inner and outer components. In Abell 1775, the halo appears diffuse at 1.3 GHz, while LOFAR images reveal steep-spectrum filaments. In Abell 1795, the inner component corresponds to a previously reported mini-halo candidate, but the full structure extends to $\\sim$1 Mpc with a spectral index of $α=-1.08\\pm0.06$. The presence of such a large, flat-spectrum halo in a dynamically relaxed cluster makes Abell 1795 an outlier relative to typical merging systems. This suggests that some relaxed clusters may still retain sufficient turbulence to sustain particle re-acceleration, or that hadronic interactions producing secondary electrons play a significant role. Together with other recent discoveries in cool-core systems, our results indicate that some large radio haloes may have been overlooked in past studies due to limited dynamic range near bright central AGN. Finally, we detect steep-spectrum emission south of Abell 1795's central AGN, tracing a 45 kpc X-ray and optical filament that terminates in an X-ray cavity, likely linked to a past AGN outburst."}

The core of the approach is local: dot-product relations in the equatorial curved geometry relate the conserved light-deflection parameter to the observed detector angle at finite distance, providing a connection between sky positions and photon constants of motion. These local identities feed a closed model for the frequency shift of photons traveling between a maser clump circularly orbiting a black hole and a finite-distance detector, making explicit the dependence on the metric at emission and detection radii.\n  We also apply the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to this construction on the equatorial two-manifold as an intrinsic cross-check. This theorem provides a global consistency relation between the local emission and detection angles, helping to validate sign conventions and angle branch choices in the local setup. In this sense, the local and global perspectives on the megamaser system support each other.\n  To supplement the instantaneous information contained in frequency shifts, we incorporate the time-domain general relativistic invariant, the redshift rapidity. We further introduce a prospective angular-domain observable, the angular redshift rate, and give its analytic expression in the SSS framework. The results are formulated for generic SSS backgrounds, providing closed relations suited for likelihood-based inference from VLBI positions and spectral monitoring. In particular, for a Schwarzschild background, the black hole mass, its distance to Earth and megamaser orbital radius are fully constrained in the language of astrophysical observables."}

Accurately simulating its dynamics is critical to improving our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, however, due to their multi-scale and multi-physics nature, multiphase systems are highly challenging to model. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of numerical simulations of multiphase gas in and around galaxies. We begin by outlining the environments where multiphase gas arises and the physical and computational challenges associated with its modeling. Key quantities that characterize multiphase gas dynamics are discussed, followed by an in-depth look at idealized setups such as turbulent mixing layers, cloud-wind interactions, thermal instability, and turbulent boxes. The review then transitions to less idealized and/or larger-scale simulations, covering radiative supernovae bubbles, tall box simulations, isolated galaxy models including dwarf and Milky Way-mass systems, and cosmological zoom-in simulations, with a particular focus on simulations that enhance resolution in the halo. Throughout, we emphasize the importance of connecting scales, extracting robust diagnostics, and comparing simulations to observations. We conclude by outlining persistent challenges and promising directions for future work in simulating the multiphase Universe."}

Cosmography is useful for interpreting data in cosmology without imposing assumptions about the field equations of gravity or the matter content in the Universe. Some cosmography methods, denoted covariant cosmography, go even further and stay agnostic to the underlying space-time metric. Due to their high level of generality, covariant cosmography methods can incorporate the anisotropies and inhomogeneities in the observer's vicinity, and may in turn inform about the associated curvature of the relevant structures in our cosmic neighbourhood. Thus, covariant cosmography is a powerful model-independent tool for analysing cosmological data while also enabling the mapping of our local cosmic neighbourhood. In order to be able to explore the covariant cosmography framework to its fullest, it must be tested in tractable models and simulations. In this paper we derive the cosmography of luminosity distance to fourth order in redshift and investigate it in the special case of axially symmetric Szekeres models. We compare the numerical results for the distance-redshift relations of synthetic observers placed within the Szekeres structures with the predictions from the cosmography, and comment on the found level of approximation of the cosmography in relation to other results in the litterature."}

Spectroscopical analyses included Balmer emission lines, Balmer + 4000 angstroms breaks or CaII lines. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with photometry include old and young stellar populations, emission lines associated to HII regions, AGN, interstellar dust extinction and intergalactic extinction from neutral hydrogen. By adopting realistic extinction curves and taking into account the V-shaped SED and low emission at near infrared at rest, the analyses show that AGN contribution in these galaxies ('little red dots' most of them) should be small on average in the reddest wavelengths, though important for few of the 31 galaxies. Average age of the 31 galaxies: $0.61\\pm 0.31$(95% CL) Gyr, while the average age of the $Λ$CDM universe is 0.70 Gyr. This corresponds to a formation epoch $z_{ form.}>11.2$(97.5% CL). Reddest galaxies present largest ages. One of these very red galaxies gets an age incompatible to be younger than the age of the Universe within $>4.7σ$. TP-AGB effect cannot explain this tension.

We performed uniform X-ray imaging and spectral analyses to measure the ICM temperature and bolometric luminosity, and investigated cluster morphology through offsets between the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the X-ray peak. Extended X-ray emission was detected from all targets, but only one system was classified as dynamically relaxed, indicating a low relaxed fraction ($\\sim 10\\%$) at high redshift. By combining this high-$z$ sample with a lower-redshift CAMIRA cluster sample, we derived scaling relations among richness, temperature, luminosity, and mass. The results are broadly consistent with predictions from both the self-similar model and the baseline model incorporating the mass--concentration relation. We find no significant redshift evolution, strengthening the view that cluster scaling relations are largely established by $z \\sim 1$. We also examined the AGN fraction among member galaxies and found significantly higher AGN activity in high-redshift clusters, particularly in the outskirts, suggesting enhanced AGN triggering during early cluster assembly and a possible connection to the thermodynamic state of dynamically young clusters. These findings provide new insights into the formation and evolution of massive clusters and the thermodynamic history of the ICM, and complement large-area X-ray surveys such as eROSITA."}

However, the extent to which B-fields are decisive relative to turbulence and gravity remains uncertain. This study aims to ascertain the role of B-fields in the fragmentation of molecular clouds. We examine the B-field observed with ALMA at core scales towards the infrared dark cloud G14.225-0.506, focusing on 3 regions with shared physical conditions, and juxtapose it with prior observations at the Hub-filament system scale. Our findings indicate a similar B-field strength and fragmentation level between the 2 hubs. However, distinct B-field morphologies are identified across the 3 regions where polarized emission is detected. In the region N, the large-scale B-field, which is perpendicular to the filamentary structure, persists at smaller scales in the southern half but becomes distorted near the more massive condensations in the northern half. Notably, these condensations exhibit signs of impending collapse, as evidenced by supercritical mass-to-flux values. In the region S, the B-field is considerably inhomogeneous among the detected condensations, and we do not observe a direct correlation between the field morphology and the condensation density. Lastly, in an isolated dust clump located within a southern filament of the northern hub, the B-field aligns parallel to the elongated emission, suggesting a transition in the field geometry. The B-field shows a clear evolution with spatial scales. We propose that the most massive condensations detected in the northern Hub are undergoing gravitational collapse, as revealed by the relative significance of the magnetic field and gravitational potential and mass-to-flux ratio. The distortion of the B-field could be a response to the flow of material due to the collapse."}

I obtained from GEMINI GMOS spectra mean radial velocities of star clusters formed in situ, which added to derived mean proper motions and heliocentric distances, allowed to compute their 3D space velocity components. These space velocities differentiate from those that the clusters would have if they instead orderly rotated with the galaxy, i.e., their residual velocities are larger than the upper limit for an object pertaining to the SMC main body rotation disk. The level of kinematic disturbance depends on the SMC rotation disk adopted; galaxy rotation disks traced using relatively old objects are discouraged.The resulting kinematic disturbance arises in younger and older stellar populations, so that the epoch of close interaction between both Magellanic Clouds cannot be uncovered on the basis of the kinematics behavior of stellar populations populating the outer SMC"}

We mentioned that their current values are similar to latest observations data and $Λ$CDM-model values. Furthermore, we plotted the fitting of the distance modulus about this model using SN Ia observation data. Therefore we find that the $f(R)$ gravity model is consistent with the SN Ia data, meanwhile, explains the late-stage acceleration of the Universe. Finally, we used various diagnostic tools including $( r, s)$, $( r, q)$, $w_{D}-w'_{D}$ plane, growth rate analysis, statefinder hierarchy and $Om(z)$-diagnostic to evaluate the observational viability of our model, we perform a systematic comparison with the standard $Λ$CDM. We found that evolutionary images can be clearly distinguished this model from the $Λ$CDM."}

However the significance of the discrepancy depends on understanding the systematic associated with crowding, metallicity effects, and extinction of the stellar tracers. Thus additional precision distance indicators in the local universe are desperately needed for investigating the H0 tension. The analysis of MUSE archival data makes the case that the Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function (PNLF) has become such an indicator, as the method can reach distances comparable to HST distances of Cepheid at a fraction of a cost, in terms of telescope time and ground-based. With new wide-field spectroscopic facilities it becomes possible to measure distances to early-type galaxies (ETGs) using the PNLF out to 100 Mpc distance, achieving a precise estimate for the H0 value which is independent of the Type Ia supernova calibration, with only single-epoch measurements."}

We investigate the velocity structure of the multitemperature X-ray gas in M87, particularly in the eastern and southwestern arms associated with past AGN outbursts, using high-resolution spectroscopy from XRISM/Resolve. We analyze a mosaic of XRISM/Resolve observations covering the core of M87, fitting single- and multi-temperature models to spectra extracted from different regions and energy bands. We assess the line-of-sight velocities and velocity dispersions of the hotter ambient and cooler uplifted gas phases, and evaluate systematic uncertainties related to instrumental gain calibration. The hotter ICM phase, traced by Fe He-$α$ emission, shows velocity dispersions below $\\sim100$ km/s, and no significant velocity shifts between the arms and a relaxed offset region, suggesting limited dynamical impact from older AGN lobes. In contrast, the cooler gas phase appears to exhibit larger line of sight velocity gradients up to several hundred km/s as well as a higher velocity dispersion than the ambient hot phase, although these conclusions remain tentative pending improvements in the robustness of the gain calibration at lower energies. The first microcalorimeter-resolved map of gas dynamics in M87 supports the uplift scenario for the X-ray arms, with the cooler gas in the east and southwest seemingly moving in opposite directions along the line of sight. The kinetic energy is a small fraction of the gravitational potential energy associated with the gas uplift, and XRISM further suggests that AGN-driven motions may be short-lived in the hot ambient ICM. These constraints provide important input towards shaping future models of AGN feedback."}

We find a critical collapse efficiency, $γ_{\\rm c} \\simeq 0.395$, above which the PBH mass grows without bound. This correction has profound implications for both PBH-induced reheating and dark matter (DM) production. Specifically, we find that the reheating temperature can be suppressed, and the DM parameter space for the PBH reheating scenario can undergo $\\mathcal{O}(10)$-$\\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ corrections, depending on the PBH formation mass and collapse efficiency. Moreover, our results significantly shift the parameter space in which PBHs can account for the entirety of the DM.

Building on this, we propose a region (minor-axis and narrow major-axis cusp lenses) where flux-ratio anomalies persist even under globally parameterized models (\"macromodels\") with multipole freedom (capturing disk, asymmetric, or merger-driven structures). Within this region, J1042+1641 is $>3σ$ incompatible with both CDM and SIDM.

The high spatial resolution of JWST cleanly separates AGN emission from host-galaxy contamination, enabling detections of high-ionization potential lines more than an order of magnitude fainter than previously measured. Emission-line diagnostics reveal a transition at log($L_{bol}/L_{Edd}$) ~ -3.5, where the spectral energy distribution becomes increasingly deficient in ultraviolet photons. We find that rotational H$_2$ excitation temperatures are elevated (~500 K higher) compared to both higher-luminosity AGN and star-forming galaxies, while the H$_2$(0-0)S(3)/PAH$_{11.3 μm}$ ratios are consistent with those observed in the AGN population. We discuss the possible roles of outflows, jets, and X-ray dominated regions in shaping the interstellar medium surrounding LLAGN.

Cosmography is useful for interpreting data in cosmology without imposing assumptions about the field equations of gravity or the matter content in the Universe. Some cosmography methods, denoted covariant cosmography, go even further and stay agnostic to the underlying space-time metric. Due to their high level of generality, covariant cosmography methods can incorporate the anisotropies and inhomogeneities in the observer's vicinity, and may in turn inform about the associated curvature of the relevant structures in our cosmic neighbourhood. Thus, covariant cosmography is a powerful model-independent tool for analysing cosmological data while also enabling the mapping of our local cosmic neighbourhood. In order to be able to explore the covariant cosmography framework to its fullest, it must be tested in tractable models and simulations. In this paper we derive the cosmography of luminosity distance to fourth order in redshift and investigate it in the special case of axially symmetric Szekeres models. We compare the numerical results for the distance-redshift relations of synthetic observers placed within the Szekeres structures with the predictions from the cosmography, and comment on the found level of approximation of the cosmography in relation to other results in the litterature."}

We adopt next stage SKA survey specifications, alone or in combination with concurrently expected DR3 Euclid survey release, paying attention to the modeling and recipe of the implementation of the galaxy clustering and lensing probes obtained from the two surveys. We consider two data mock models: one with deviation of the intermediate parameters at the level of 10 \\% (yielding however $w_{\\rm eff}=-1.03$) and another sub-percently close to $Λ$CDM. We found that the three parameters deviation from $Λ$CDM could only be detected at 1 $σ$ from SKA alone, while this improves to $\\sim$ 2 $σ$ when we combine with Euclid. An improvement of the order of 30\\% on the bounds is reached after projecting the three parameters into a single $w_{\\rm eff}$ parameter. However, this affects both cases and thus it does not change much, though it improves the level of detection with respect to $Λ$CDM values. We conclude that synergy from both surveys benefits to tighten our constraints, but also that our highly generalized parameterization, although impacting at both the background and the perturbation level, will be hard to disentangle from $Λ$CDM at the level at which our forecast is performed and it still needs, to the least, data from more advanced stages of the adopted surveys to hope reach this target."}

Submitted to MNRAS. Comments are welcome", "summary": "Tomographic reconstruction of reionization is a long-sought goal. It would move the field beyond global summary statistics, such as the volume-averaged ionised fraction, to direct, field-level constraints on the ionization topology. With this in mind, we present TORRCH (TOmographic Reconstruction of the Reionization of Cosmic Hydrogen), a deep-learning framework that reconstructs the neutral-hydrogen fraction field during the epoch of reionization from the spatial distributions of Ly$α$ emitters (LAEs) and non-Ly$α$-selected galaxies (NLSGs) at luminosity limits comparable to current surveys. Using hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with radiative transfer, we train a deterministic 3D U-Net on mock surveys spanning diverse reionization scenarios and predict the neutral-fraction field. We find that TORRCH recovers the large-scale ionization morphology from synthetic data comparable to current surveys with high fidelity, and reproduces both the one-point distribution and the 2D power spectrum of projected neutral fractions. The predicted galaxy-IGM cross-correlation is also captured well, including the expected small-scale anti-correlation and its decline towards zero at large separations. Reconstruction quality depends on tracer completeness, with deep joint LAE+NLSG samples yielding the most accurate morphology, while LAE-only selections retain bubble-scale topology but with reduced fidelity. Robustness tests show that the method is stable to variations in ionization conditions between training and test data, and to realistic redshift uncertainties. Our results suggest that galaxy-based tomography can potentially deliver reliable reionization maps across realistic survey redshift windows."}

However, its value is often determined by considering an asymptotic constant value that works for all redshift, or else following a chosen parameterisation. Here we formulate the growth index as function of three quantities that could be directly related to observables in redshift bins, $fσ_8(z_i)$, $f(z_i)$ and $H(z_i)$. We determine its value and its derivative at observed nodal center of redshift bins and use the shape function method, after showing insightful connection with its underlying governing virtual-work conservation principle, to construct a redshift dependence of the $γ$ without assuming a specific parameterization. We then use the resulting shape function to test if we can disentangle between different scenarios where there are discrepancies between its three constituent measured components. We also tested whether it can be used to rule out models of modified gravity, or extended parametric models of the growth index that capture more general behaviors with an additional parameter as function of the scale factor or dark energy. Adopting forecasted measurements from next generation surveys on the three quantities used to construct $γ$, we find that reported discrepancies between them could be detected with our method, but at the bins where the errors and lost of precision from our addition of degrees of freedom is small with respect to the deviation of $γ$. The same could be concluded for first order extensions to $γ$ or common modified gravity models, and to a lesser degree for dynamical dark energy models after supposing the latest DESI values. We conclude that this method is a strong tool to investigate cosmology in a model-independent way especially with forthcoming data delivered by further stage-IV surveys with more stringent uncertainties.(Abridged)"}

We measure the ARF power spectra from the Quaia catalog and combine their information with the 2D (projected) galaxy density and their cross-correlation with the $Planck$ PR4 CMB lensing maps lensing to jointly constrain $f_{\\rm NL}$. Assuming the universality relation, we measure $f_{\\rm NL} = -3 \\pm 14$ at 68% confidence level by combining Quaia quasar angular density and ARF with the CMB lensing. This result is the second tightest constraint on $f_{\\rm NL}$ using LSS two-point statistics to date and the best measurement achieved using two-point projected summary statistics, improving by $\\sim$25% the previous measurement from Quaia. Our results motivate the inclusion of ARF as an additional cosmological observable in future 2D analysis of upcoming datasets from large surveys."}

Using the largest microlensing-free flux ratios for 17 quadruply imaged cusps, we combine these with extensive Monte Carlo simulations of mock lens realizations under cold dark matter (CDM), self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), and fuzzy dark matter (FDM) scenarios. Building on this, we propose a region (minor-axis and narrow major-axis cusp lenses) where flux-ratio anomalies persist even under globally parameterized models (\"macromodels\") with multipole freedom (capturing disk, asymmetric, or merger-driven structures). Within this region, J1042+1641 is $>3σ$ incompatible with both CDM and SIDM. Our results yield a Bayes factor exceeding $100$, providing very strong evidence for FDM over even the most optimistic CDM and SIDM scenarios. As only 11 cusp lenses lie within this region, extending to larger samples will be essential for assessing its statistical generality and for decisively confirming these findings with future microlensing-free flux ratio data."}

Submitted to MNRAS. Comments are welcome", "summary": "We explore the feasibility of using Lyman-$α$ (Ly$α$) forests to calibrate the ensemble redshift distribution of the high-redshift tail ($2<z<3$) of photometric galaxies. We use \\texttt{CoLoRe} simulations to create mock DESI 5-year Ly$α$ forests and Rubin Observatory LSST 10-year photometric galaxies up to $z=3$, and measure the galaxy redshift distribution via their angular cross-correlations. Due to large redshift-space distortions in the Ly$α$ forest, the conventional $n(z)$ estimator for clustering redshifts does not apply, and we develope a theoretical framework to model the angular cross-correlation directly. Using the simulations, we explore effects of instrumental noise, continuum fitting, and contamination in the Ly$α$ forest, cross-correlation angular scales ($θ$), and redshift bin size ($Δz$) on the signal-to-noise (SNR) of the measurements. We find that continuum fitting methods strongly impact the SNR of the measurements. With our baseline continuum fitting method, \\texttt{LyCAN}, at angular scales $θ\\sim10$ arcmin and $Δz=0.1$, we measure the cross-correlation signal at $24σ$. If the shape of the redshift distribution and galaxy bias evolution are known well for $z<2$, the cross-correlation can constrain the mean redshift of the galaxy sample to $σ_z/(1+\\bar{z}) = 0.006$ at a mean redshift of $\\bar{z}=2$. This demonstrates that Ly$α$ cross-correlation is a reliable and promising method to calibrate the high-redshift tails of photometric Stage IV galaxy surveys."}

We first deform the GR Hamiltonian by adding an extra weight $+1$ density to the potential. We show that potential deformations of this type leave the (reduced) Dirac algebra unchanged and the modification is naturally reinterpreted as an effective anisotropic stress energy contribution. While the fluid reproduces an isothermal-like mass scaling, its pressure anisotropy prevents it from giving flat rotation curves. We then turn to HL gravity, where the deformed Dirac algebra induces a controlled nonconservation law for an emergent dust component. Generalizing earlier results, we identify a restricted class of LTB backgrounds for which the HL source term yields a positive scaling dark matter density, consistent with ghost-freedom, and recovery of GR in the infrared. The analysis is conditional on a prescribed background: obtaining a fully backreacted areal radius solution consistent with the HL field equations is left as a natural direction for future work."}

Gutierrez"], "title": "Improved measurements of the age of JWST galaxies at z=6-10", "comment": "14 pages, 8 figures, accepted to be published in MNRAS", "summary": "From James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) surveys, 31 galaxies with average redshift 7.3 are selected containing large Balmer break, Lyman-$α$ break (V-shaped SED versus $λ$). Apart from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and JWST-NIRCam (Near-infrared camera) photometry for these galaxies, there are JWST-NIRSpec (Near-infrared spectrograph) spectra for 13 galaxies and mid-infrared photometry (mostly JWST-MIRI) for 15 of them. Spectroscopical analyses included Balmer emission lines, Balmer + 4000 angstroms breaks or CaII lines. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with photometry include old and young stellar populations, emission lines associated to HII regions, AGN, interstellar dust extinction and intergalactic extinction from neutral hydrogen. By adopting realistic extinction curves and taking into account the V-shaped SED and low emission at near infrared at rest, the analyses show that AGN contribution in these galaxies ('little red dots' most of them) should be small on average in the reddest wavelengths, though important for few of the 31 galaxies. Average age of the 31 galaxies: $0.61\\pm 0.31$(95% CL) Gyr, while the average age of the $Λ$CDM universe is 0.70 Gyr. This corresponds to a formation epoch $z_{ form.}>11.2$(97.5% CL). Reddest galaxies present largest ages. One of these very red galaxies gets an age incompatible to be younger than the age of the Universe within $>4.7σ$. TP-AGB effect cannot explain this tension. None the less, there may be other uncertainties in the models, so this tension is a provisional result and further research is needed to confirm it."}

Determining Distances out to 100 Mpc and the Renaissance of the PN Luminosity Function Method", "comment": "2 pages, 1 figure, submitted to the ESO Expanding Horizons call in December 2025", "summary": "The discrepancy of the Hubble parameter H0 as measured from the cosmic microwave background versus that found from traditional distance ladder measurements has produced considerable discussion about the need for another force in cosmology. However the significance of the discrepancy depends on understanding the systematic associated with crowding, metallicity effects, and extinction of the stellar tracers. Thus additional precision distance indicators in the local universe are desperately needed for investigating the H0 tension. The analysis of MUSE archival data makes the case that the Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function (PNLF) has become such an indicator, as the method can reach distances comparable to HST distances of Cepheid at a fraction of a cost, in terms of telescope time and ground-based. With new wide-field spectroscopic facilities it becomes possible to measure distances to early-type galaxies (ETGs) using the PNLF out to 100 Mpc distance, achieving a precise estimate for the H0 value which is independent of the Type Ia supernova calibration, with only single-epoch measurements."}

We investigate the velocity structure of the multitemperature X-ray gas in M87, particularly in the eastern and southwestern arms associated with past AGN outbursts, using high-resolution spectroscopy from XRISM/Resolve. We analyze a mosaic of XRISM/Resolve observations covering the core of M87, fitting single- and multi-temperature models to spectra extracted from different regions and energy bands. We assess the line-of-sight velocities and velocity dispersions of the hotter ambient and cooler uplifted gas phases, and evaluate systematic uncertainties related to instrumental gain calibration. The hotter ICM phase, traced by Fe He-$α$ emission, shows velocity dispersions below $\\sim100$ km/s, and no significant velocity shifts between the arms and a relaxed offset region, suggesting limited dynamical impact from older AGN lobes. In contrast, the cooler gas phase appears to exhibit larger line of sight velocity gradients up to several hundred km/s as well as a higher velocity dispersion than the ambient hot phase, although these conclusions remain tentative pending improvements in the robustness of the gain calibration at lower energies. The first microcalorimeter-resolved map of gas dynamics in M87 supports the uplift scenario for the X-ray arms, with the cooler gas in the east and southwest seemingly moving in opposite directions along the line of sight. The kinetic energy is a small fraction of the gravitational potential energy associated with the gas uplift, and XRISM further suggests that AGN-driven motions may be short-lived in the hot ambient ICM. These constraints provide important input towards shaping future models of AGN feedback."}
