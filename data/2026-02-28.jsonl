The analysis extends the previously considered WKB expansion of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation to modified gravity theories, up to second order. We apply the general method for homogeneous and isotropic FLRW universes, with zero and positive spatial curvature, for any $f(R)$ model. For the flat case we obtain analytic expressions for the transition probabilities for any model if we assume a constant Ricci scalar; this assumption has been considered in previous studies, in the Euclidean approach, from symmetry arguments. On the other hand, we also obtain explicit solutions without this assumption for power-law $f(R)=R^{1+n}$ models. Moreover, in the positive curvature scenario, we obtain that the assumption of a constant Ricci scalar is not consistent, but we are able to find analytical solutions in approximated regimes. In all cases we have found that the general behavior of the probabilities already found for Einstein Gravity is preserved, including the prediction of a non-singular initial state due to quantum corrections, even though the probabilities increase or decrease in a model dependent way."}

We analytically constructed the expansion coefficients in both limits and used them as a basis to investigate gravitational lensing effects through observables, taking into account the variation of the parameters involved in the model, both for the canonical field and the phantom case."}

The solution is characterized by the electric charge $q$, the $F(R)$ deviation $f_{R_0}$, the Euler--Heisenberg coupling $λ$, and the constant scalar curvature $R_0$. We establish a universal entropy--extremality relation that provides thermodynamic evidence for the WGC independently of $f_{R_0}$ and $R_0$. Photon sphere analysis from both geodesic and topological perspectives confirms the simultaneous compatibility of the WGC and WCCC, with the Euler--Heisenberg coupling restoring photon spheres in the naked singularity regime. Gravitational lensing in the strong- and weak-deflection limits reveals that the photon sphere radius is independent of the cosmological background while the critical impact parameter nearly doubles in de Sitter. Black hole shadow images under isotropic accretion are constructed. Within the Barrow entropy framework, we uncover van der Waals-type phase transitions and analyze Joule-Thomson expansion, identifying the small black hole phase as the WGC-compatible thermodynamic regime accessible via isenthalpic cooling."}

To this end, we first derive the equations of motion for both fields on the aforementioned background; these equations are then reformulated uniformly into the Teukolsky equation. Since the Teukolsky equation in asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes can be mapped into the Heun equation, we are able to solve quasinormal spectra by employing the Heun function method, not only for photon sphere modes but also for de Sitter and near-extremal modes. We analyze the spectra of all three types for both fields and, in particular, ascertain the effects of the global monopole. In the near-extremal regime, we find that the presence of a global monopole, on the one hand, leaves the strong cosmic censorship conjecture unaffected for scalar perturbations, while on the other hand, it enhance the violation of strong cosmic censorship for Dirac perturbations. Furthermore, we identify that the impact of the global monopole on both the spectra and the strong cosmic censorship is achieved by a shift in the modified multipole number. Our work demonstrates that the Heun function method is an efficient and robust approach for exploring the interaction between asymptotically de Sitter black holes and perturbing fields."}

The choice of lattice is adapted such that it remains invariant under a set of symmetry transformations maximally mapping spherical symmetry to the discrete setting. The conditions for symmetry restriction of the dynamics are investigated and a subspace is identified to make computations feasible. Afterwards symplectic structure and scalar constraint are explicitly computed on this subspace. This lays the groundwork to target several particular solutions, such $k=1$ cosmology and black holes, which will serve as the subjects of forthcoming follow-up papers."}

We explain why such models have unphysical velocity distributions unless the DFs of hot components satisfy certain conditions as J_φ-> 0. We show how DFs for both isotropic and radially biased spherical systems can be constructed with specified f(J). We show how to construct DFs for flattened systems with significant velocity anisotropy. Construction of self-consistent models rather than populations that are confined by an external potential leads to the conclusion that radially-biased spherical systems are generically unstable to quadrupolar perturbations. Chaos is likely key to maintenance of these constraints during adiabatic disc growth."}

Submitted to the Astrophysical Journal on Nov 10 2025, accepted on Feb 7 2026", "summary": "The Perseus Cluster has been precisely measured by the legacy Hitomi telescope on the Si-group (Si, S, Ar, Ca) and Fe-group elements (Cr, Mn, Ni). These element abundance ratios provide insight into the typical behaviour of supernovae. In Paper II, we presented new massive star explosion models at various metallicity, assuming spherical explosions. We show that while the fitting is improved, some features (e.g., Ni/Fe) remain to be improved. In this article, we extend our calculation to an aspherical explosion using the jet-induced explosion mechanism. The detailed pre- and post-explosion chemical profiles are calculated with a large post-processing network to capture the production of odd-number elements (V, Mn, Cu) and iron-group elements. We further explore how the jet-driven explosions create the diversity of models which could be compatible with the observed diversity in terms of $^{56}$Ni-mass vs ejecta mass, Ti-V relation, and stellar abundances. Finally, we apply the new collapsar models in the Galactic Chemical Evolution context. We study how the galactic stars, including the Zn-enriched star HE 1327-2326, can put constraints on the relative rates of collapsar and some of its model parameters. We show that collapsar could lead to significant changes in some elements, e.g., Zn. Our study shows that the collapsar is a necessary component to explain multiple elemental trends observed in the Milky Way Galaxy."}
