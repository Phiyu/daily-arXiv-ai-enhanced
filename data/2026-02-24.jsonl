We derive binary membership and orbital parameters for 103 SB1s by analysing APOGEE radial velocities with The Joker and UltraNest. We perform a detailed abundance analysis with BACCHUS to derive abundances in fourteen chemical species: Si, Fe, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, Ce, and Nd. Leveraging the assumptions of chemical homogeneity in open clusters, we compare the surface abundances of SB1s to non-binary stars at similar evolutionary states. We find that a subset of binaries with significant UV excess have a $Δ$[C/N] that is 0.2--0.5 dex higher than expected, resulting in overestimated [C/N]-based ages for those stars. This points to pollution from an evolved companion and has implications for [C/N]-based age studies of the broader Milky Way. At the population level, we find that SB1s in our sample can be treated as statistically chemically homogeneous with their single-star counterparts, and we find no connection between orbital separation and chemical enrichment or depletion. We show that at separations up to ~5 pc, co-eval stars can be considered chemically homogeneous with one another within current abundance precisions, regardless of multiplicity."}

This raises a fundamental question: can a single physical model of star formation and dust production explain both populations across cosmic time? We address this using a minimal framework with only two free parameters--the instantaneous star formation efficiency ($ε_\\star$) and the dust yield per Type II supernova ($y_d$)--and predict the rest-frame UV and IR luminosity functions (LFs) from $z \\simeq 14$ to 7. For a uniform ISM, we find a UV-IR tension at the bright end of the LFs at $z \\ge 7$. The UV LF requires low dust yields ($y_d \\lesssim 0.01\\,M_\\odot$), whereas the $z=7$ IR LF requires higher yields ($y_d \\sim 0.1\\,M_\\odot$) unless the star formation efficiency is boosted above $ε_\\star \\approx 5$-10%. We show that incorporating a porous, turbulent ISM largely resolves this tension: turbulence opens low-column-density sightlines that enhance the UV escape fraction while leaving the total absorbed energy--and thus the IR luminosity--nearly unchanged once radiative-transfer--induced flattening of the attenuation curve is included. Large-grain dust distributions, while reducing UV opacity, play a secondary role once ISM porosity and radiative transfer are taken into account. At $z > 10$, however, even strong turbulence cannot reproduce the bright end of the UV LF at high dust yield. This could be resolved either by efficient dust removal in early massive systems or by substantial ISM dust growth by $z \\simeq 7$. Our results highlight dust physics as a key lever for interpreting the rapidly growing UV and IR constraints within the broader context of early galaxy formation."}

To evaluate their accuracy and limitations, we generate synthetic HI Zeeman spectra from magnetohydrodynamic simulations and idealized cloud models, and analyze the resulting Stokes I and V profiles using two complementary methods. Approach I uses the classical relation between Stokes V and dI/dν to estimate LOS-averaged magnetic fields, achieving an upper-limit relative error of 16% (half-width of 68.27% confidence interval) for a representative noise level of 0.014 K. Approach II applies Gaussian decomposition to Stokes I and V to estimate component-level magnetic fields, yielding a 13% relative error quantifying the same confidence range, reflecting the intrinsic uncertainty of such Zeeman estimates. Both approaches recover the original fields under uniform-field conditions and remain robust in turbulent environments. Approach I provides a simple and reliable LOS-averaged field estimate, while Approach II, although more complex, offers statistical insight into magnetic field variations along the LOS. We further show that joint fitting of Stokes I and V generally outperforms sequential fitting, particularly in the presence of attenuation. Increasing noise eight-fold produces a more modest rise in uncertainty, doubling to a 26% relative error, while substantial optical depth introduces only a minor additional contribution to the overall uncertainty. Applying these methods to FAST observations of the L1544 star-forming region, we confirm the previously reported LOS magnetic field strength, demonstrating the validity of Zeeman analysis in this benchmark core."}

We assess the latent space of the CNN and CvAE using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) along with independently quantified metrics of residual strength (significant pixel flux $SPF$, Bumpiness, and Residual Flux Fraction). We also employ an unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) based clustering scheme with Support Vector Classification (SVC) to identify groupings in PCA space that correspond to similar residual substructure. We find that our supervised CNN latent features in PCA space correlate with the $SPF$ values and distinguish between qualitatively strong and weak residual substructures. While our unsupervised CvAE latent space also correlates with visual and quantitative residual characteristics, but lacks clear discriminatory power when characterizing different residual substructures."}

Building on a previously developed formalism for ndimensional density matrices, we characterize each state by a normalized global purity index and two complementary indices, which quantify the contributions of level populations and coherences. This yields a simple quadratic relation and a geometric representation in a population-coherence plane, where different routes to purity can be distinguished. In the two-level case we construct explicit families of states with identical spectra and global purity but opposite internal structure, realizing population-dominated and coherence-dominated routes. We then apply this framework to a standard Page-type evaporation model without an explicit Hamiltonian, in which a black hole and its Hawking radiation form a bipartite pure state with varying Hilbert-space dimensions. Using known results for typical reduced states in large dimensions, we analyze the behavior of population and coherence components of purity along the evaporation process. Under the physically motivated requirement that, in this energy-free setting, the radiation populations remain nearly uniform in the chosen basis, we show that the late-time recovery of purity must be coherence-dominated: the global purity of the radiation approaches unity while the population index stays small and the coherence index carries essentially all the purity."}

We identify 79 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members with reliable radio emission and classify them into compact, extended, and tailed subsamples according to their radio morphologies. By combining their radio and optical properties, we find compact radio sources are predominantly associated with massive, quiescent galaxies driven by AGN activity, while tailed sources are largely hosted by star-forming galaxies, tracing ongoing ram pressure stripping (RPS). Using phase-space analysis and a projected infall time proxy ($d_R$), we find that extended sources are preferentially located in the cluster outskirts ($d_R > 1$), while tailed sources are concentrated in the intermediate infall region ($0.4 < d_R < 1.0$), highlighting the influence of the dense intracluster medium."}

In linear $f(Q)$ gravity of the form $f(Q)=β_1 Q+β_2$, the theory is dynamically equivalent to General Relativity at the geometric level and modifies stellar structure solely through a uniform rescaling of the matter sector governed by $β_1$. Consequently, linear $f(Q)$ alone does not introduce new geometric families of stellar solutions or alter classical compactness bounds. To overcome this structural limitation, we incorporate gravitational decoupling within an embedding class-I (Karmarkar) Vaidya-Tikekar configuration in linear $f(Q)$ gravity. While similar VT-based decoupling constructions exist in GR, the present framework introduces a controlled two-parameter deformation characterized by $(ε,β_1)$: the decoupling parameter $ε$ governs geometric deformation and EOS stiffness, whereas $β_1$ independently rescales the matter sector without altering the metric structure. This separation permits a direct comparison between GR and linear $f(Q)$ gravity at fixed geometric deformation, thereby isolating pure coupling-driven mass enhancement. We determine the admissible parameter domain from regularity, matching, causality and compactness requirements and derive an analytic compactness bound for the decoupled embedding class-I configuration. The combined action of $ε$ and $β_1$ enlarges the accessible stellar mass window while preserving physical acceptability, allowing configurations compatible with recent high-mass pulsars and mass-gap candidates without exceeding causal limits."}

The SBPs also have a significant impact in extended models, with the dark energy figure-of-merit improving by $70\\%$ ($20\\%$) in a $w_0w_a$CDM analysis when combining with the CMB (and supernovae). In the SBP analysis, we do not find statistically significant evidence for dynamical dark energy: the equation of state parameters are consistent with a cosmological constant within $2.2σ$ ($1.4σ$) in analyses without (with) supernovae.

The mass ratios of bulges and disks increase statistically with the galaxy mass, with the high-mass end occupied by elliptical galaxies. Although previous theoretical studies have succeeded in reproducing this morphological sequence, it is not yet fully understood why and how this morphological sequence emerged. Galaxy mergers accompanying dark matter halo mergers have been proposed as the major route for bulge formation. On the other hand, it is observationally known that the mass fraction of galaxies (stars plus cold gas) in dark matter halos attains the peak value at $M_{\\rm halo} \\sim 10^{12} {\\rm M}_\\odot$ throughout the cosmic time. Using a simple galaxy evolution model including mergers, we show that this feature is the fundamental cause of the morphological sequence. Halos hosting massive galaxies, which stay more massive than this peak mass for long periods during their growth, merge mostly with satellite halos having larger galaxy mass fractions than themselves. Such mergers increase the bulge mass fraction efficiently. In contrast, host halos of low-mass galaxies evolve under unfavorable condition for bulge growth because they stay below the peak mass and merge with satellite halos with smaller galaxy mass fractions. Previous studies suggest that the peak in galaxy mass fraction is created by feedback processes from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and young massive stars including supernovae (SN), which are considered to suppress star formation in high-mass and low-mass galaxies, respectively. This study thus points to a close relationship between the galaxy morphology and feedback processes which have hitherto been considered unrelated and suggests the importance of further investigation into their causal relationship."}

In this study, we utilise the IllustrisTNG simulation suite to investigate the statistical relationship between the splashback and shock surfaces in a sample of 812 cluster-mass halos. We compute the full angular distribution of both boundaries and examine their relationship, also considering how different moments of this distribution correlate with halo properties. We employ a dispersion-based measure for the splashback boundary and the maximum entropy distance for the shock location. Despite examining various boundary definitions, we consistently observe an offset between the splashback and shock boundaries, with $R_{\\rm sh}/R_{\\rm sp} \\sim 1.3-2$, depending on specific methodological choices. This offset predominantly occurs along void directions. We analyse the redshift evolution of these boundaries for a subset of halos and find that splashback and shock boundaries are not necessarily distinct at earlier times. During mergers, gas dissipates energy and resists contraction via pressure, unlike collisionless dark matter, leading to the observed boundary offset. We also find that the feature in pressure profiles arising from the outer accretion shock is sensitive to the exact method of stacking, which has important implications for observations."}

Starting from a recently proposed classification of affine connections compatible with both the symmetries of spacetime and the constraints of symmetric teleparallel geometry, we develop a systematic approach to solve the full field equations. We first identify two distinct classes of connections that satisfy the off-diagonal metric field equations and the connection constraints. For an arbitrary $f(\\mathbb{Q})$ function when the non-metricity scalar $\\mathbb{Q}$ vanishes, we recover exact analytical solutions equivalent to those of general relativity, including the Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild (anti)de-Sitter metrics. We then extend our analysis beyond general relativity by considering the quadratic model $f(\\mathbb{Q})=\\mathbb{Q}+α~\\mathbb{Q}^2$ with a small parameter $α$. Using a perturbative approach, we derive asymptotically flat, analytical solutions up to second order in $α$. These solutions exhibit corrections to the standard Schwarzschild metric, characterized by new integration constants that can be interpreted as connection hair. We explore the asymptotic behavior of these solutions and disclose that the horizon radius receives corrections that can be expressed compactly using the Lambert $\\mathcal{W}$ function. Our results provide new, non-trivial vacuum solutions within $f(\\mathbb{Q})$ gravity and highlight the rich structure introduced by the non-metricity connection."}

To achieve a robust combination that accounts for the correlation between the two data releases, we employ the ShapeFit compression method and estimate the joint covariance using EZmocks. This compressed approach inherently mitigates the prior volume effects that have previously dominated Bayesian constraints from DESI data with minimal external priors. Consequently, we obtain--for the first time within a Bayesian framework--reliable DESI-only constraints on extensions to $Λ$CDM using only a Big Bang Nucleosynthesis prior on the baryon density and a wide prior on the spectral index. In flat $Λ$CDM, we find $Ω_m = 0.3035 \\pm 0.0085$, $h = 0.6876 \\pm 0.0059$, and $σ_8 = 0.822 \\pm 0.034$.

To systematically investigate AGNs flux density variability in radio bands, a long-term program was initiated in late 2016: quasi-Simultaneous Multiwavelength Monitoring of gamma-ray-loud AGNs with the Nanshan 26-m radio telescope (SMMAN). This work presents the first data release of the SMMAN program, spanning over eight years from 2016 to 2024 with observations at 4.8 and 23.6 GHz. The SMMAN sample includes 131 northern ($δ>\\sim0^{\\circ}$) sources selected from the Fermi Large Area Telescope third source catalog. The characteristics of variability, spectral index, luminosity, and $γ$-ray loudness factor are examined for different AGN classes within the sample. Target sources exhibit stronger variability at 23.6 GHz compared to 4.8 GHz, with BL Lac objects being more variable than flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). BL Lacs generally have flatter radio spectra, while FSRQs, blazar candidates of uncertain type (BCUs), and radio galaxies (RDGs) span a wider range from flat to steep. FSRQs are more radio-luminous than BL Lacs and other classes, with BCUs intermediate and RDGs generally fainter. FSRQs and BL Lacs have higher $γ$-ray loudness factors than RDGs, while BCUs have intermediate values. The SMMAN dataset, incorporated with other historical and ongoing monitoring programs, will provide a unique opportunity to investigate the evolution of spectral energy distributions, search for quasi-periodic oscillations, and analyze supermassive black hole binary systems."}

The cosmological behavior of the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, the jerk, the snap parameter $s(z)$, and the effective equation of state parameter $ω$ is also analyzed. The results indicate that the Universe transitioned from deceleration to late-time accelerated expansion, consistent with the $Λ$CDM model. Analysis of the energy conditions reveals that the NEC and DEC are satisfied, while the SEC is violated, which explains the transition from a decelerating matter-dominated epoch to the present accelerated phase.

Parameters of different dark matter density profiles are estimated by using the most recent upper bound on dark mass near the black hole. These profiles are then used for calculating the gravitational potential and hence the relativistic pericentre shift of both low and high eccentricity orbits of 13 S-stars. We use the recently measured deviation parameter $f_{sp}$ for investigating competition between dark matter and gravitational physics within S2's orbit. The astrometric shift of the pericentres has been calculated and compared with existing and upcoming astrometric capabilities of large and extremely large telescopes. The orbit of S2 is found to be insensitive to dark matter induced precession. Low eccentricity and wider orbits are prominent probes for measuring dark matter induced precession which is accessible to present and upcoming astrometric facilities such as Keck, GRAVITY and TMT. The existing and upcoming facilities can distinguish between different dark matter profiles for some stars and hence they posses the capability to distinguish between possible formation histories of the central region of our Galaxy."}

We discuss the possibility that such behavior arises from cyclic condensate dynamics in Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) cosmology. In the Fukuyama--Morikawa--Tatekawa framework, repeated collapse and re-formation episodes of a self-interacting condensate occur over characteristic timescales of order several $10^8$ years. When mapped into redshift space, this temporal periodicity naturally translates into an approximately constant spacing in $\\ln(1+z)$.\n  While the observed frequency is not interpreted as a sharp theoretical prediction, its magnitude is quantitatively consistent with the intrinsic cycle timescale of QCD-axion motivated condensate dynamics.

We study a test gyroscope attached to a stationary observer and derive closed-form expressions for the Lense--Thirring, geodetic, and general spin-precession frequencies. A sharp qualitative distinction emerges: for Kerr--Newman black holes, the spin-precession frequency generically diverges as the horizon is approached (remaining finite only for the ZAMO family), whereas for Kerr--Newman naked singularities, the precession remains finite throughout the spacetime, with divergences confined to the ring singularity on the equatorial plane. Working with physically admissible stationary observers (including ZAMOs), we first construct the timelike geodesic motion and the fundamental orbital frequencies for equatorial circular orbits. Using these, we analyse the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, the ISCO shift induced by the charge parameter $Q$, and the associated periastron and nodal precession frequencies relevant to quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). We demonstrate that nonzero $Q$ produces systematic, and in rapidly rotating regimes nontrivial, modifications to the frequency hierarchy: $ν_{\\rm nod}$ can develop a finite maximum at $r=r_p=\\mathcal{O}(M)$, its peak amplitude decreases with increasing $Q$, and sign reversals may occur for sufficiently large charge and high spin, signalling a reversal of nodal-precession orientation.

For the comparison, we select five galaxies simulated with the chemodynamical Tree-SPH code GEAR with stellar masses in the range of log(M*/Msol) between 6.1 and 10.8, and at six different redshifts between 0.33 and 4.12. We find that the abundance ratios [α/Fe] and [M/H] observed in the interstellar medium (ISM) of DLA galaxies overlap with the abundance trends in gas of the simulated galaxies. Our findings corroborate a picture in which DLAs with Δv90 below and above 100 km/s trace galaxies with masses in the ranges of log M* 6 - 8 and 8 - 11 solar masses, respectively. We suggest that observations should be used with caution when constraining the theoretical [α/Fe] vs. sSFR relations because of systematics (if abundances are obtained from emission lines) or differences in the gas properties as probed by a DLA and its counterpart. So far, only the observations in absorption of inner gas of the LMC and SMC are in agreement with the simulated data. We confirm that DLAs detected at large impact parameters most likely probe the gas of satellite or other halo galaxies which are adjacent to the central galaxy.

Tomography improves $b_{\\mathrm{HSE}}$ precision by factors of approximately three relative to non-tomographic analyses, reflecting the role of redshift information in breaking the $b_{\\mathrm{HSE}}$--$σ_8$ degeneracy. Optical-only probes provide no direct constraint on $b_{\\mathrm{HSE}}$, whereas inclusion of tSZ-containing spectra enables percent-level calibration under realistic systematic assumptions. The results demonstrate that multi-probe tomographic analyses with Stage-IV surveys can achieve robust control of hydrostatic mass bias, strengthening cluster-based constraints on structure growth."}

They are characterised by three pairs of radio lobes, where each pair of lobes represents an episode of nuclear activity. Such a feature makes them key objects that can be used to constrain the duty cycle of RGs. In this paper, we report the discovery of J022248\\m060934, a new TDRG, hosted by a galaxy at a spectroscopic redshift of $z \\approx$ 0.94. We have used the MIGHTEE-DR1 data set and MIGHTEE sub-band images as our main data. In total intensity, J022248\\m060934 has a bright core and triple-double, edge-brightened-like peaks of radio emission. The polarimetry of the source reveals an inhomogeneous density of the hosting environment which is consistent with the more pronounced bending in its eastern lobes. The spectral index and curvature maps suggest an inverted core and an ultra-steepening of the spectrum towards the outer lobes which reinforce a recurrent nuclear activity. We perform individual spectral age fitting of the components of the source using the JP model and we found a lower limit total age of $\\sim$16 Myr. We also derive a short inactive period between the active phases and a rapid duty cycle of 90 per cent for the first cycle of activity. Our spectral ageing analysis suggests that the triple-double structure in TDRGs is not the product of long quiescent periods, as deduced by previous works based on kinematic ages."}

In optical radial coordinates, and using the Kodama--Ishibashi gauge-invariant formalism, each radiative multipole is encoded by a single scalar master field on the half-line. The resulting master equation is of Regge--Wheeler type, with an inverse-square potential core at the optical apex (controlled by a Hardy inequality) and a short-range tail at infinity. The spatial-plus-potential part of the Einstein--Maxwell $T$-energy is closable and bounded below, which defines a positive quadratic form on the natural energy space. Its Friedrichs extension then gives the canonical self-adjoint realization of the master operator. The static Coulomb field and its nonlinear gravitational backreaction are treated as the exact background. All linear Einstein--Maxwell perturbations with finite spatial $T$-energy evolve unitarily on the energy space. The naked singularity at finite optical distance is ``silent'' in the technical sense that it carries no $T$-energy flux. We also construct the forward radiation field at future null infinity, obtaining a translation representation of the self-field dynamics in which the conserved $T$-energy coincides with the $L^2$ norm of the radiation profile in retarded time."}

We compare unperturbed accretion with a case featuring plasma density bubbles with pressure balanced magnetic islands of different amplitudes. Power spectrum analysis of accretion time series, performed via the Blackman-Tukey method, shows that the perturbed case exhibits (1) steeper spectral indices compared to the unperturbed case, deviating from the characteristic $1/ω$ noise spectrum, and (2) increased correlation times, providing evidence for absorption of macro-structures at the event horizon. Spatial auto-correlation analysis of near-horizon turbulence confirms larger energy-containing coherent structures in the perturbed case altering the accretion rate. These results provide new insights for interpreting observations of supermassive black hole environments, where near-horizon turbulence may play a key role in the accretion process."}

No statistically significant evidence for defects is found, although we observe a mild preference for non-zero cosmic string tension. Our results improve previous constraints on the defect power spectrum by up to a factor of two. In the particular case of strings, the improvement is driven by the $B$-mode data, and is especially pronounced for Abelian-Higgs strings.

We applied the domain-informed novelty detection CLustering in Multiphase Boundaries (CLiMB) framework to identify RRL membership in the MW substructures. We analysed the metallicity distributions of RRLs in major accreted system remnants as a snapshot of their chemical evolutionary status during early epochs. We calculated the weighted mean metallicity ([Fe/H]) and the corresponding standard deviation for Gaia Sausage/Enceladus ([Fe/H] = $-1.57 \\pm 0.25$ dex), Sequoia ([Fe/H] =$ -1.64\\pm0.26$ dex), and the Helmi streams ([Fe/H] = $-1.66\\pm0.19$ dex). The metallicity distribution of RRLs in Thamnos was found to be bimodal, with the metal-poor peak likely representing the genuine accreted Thamnos population ([Fe/H] = $-1.94\\pm0.20$ dex), in agreement with recent works based on spectroscopic abundances. Our analysis shows that the substructures ED-1 and L-RL3 are highly contaminated by thick disc stars. However, the metal-poor tails in their metallicity distributions may be signatures of remnants from small accreted systems. We also identify over-densities of RRLs in correspondence with the recently reported substructures Shiva and Shakti, which we suggest are of in-situ origin.

They can form either internally, via dynamical instabilities, or externally, triggered by interactions with other galaxies. The impact of mergers on bar formation and survival, however, has not been thoroughly investigated. To explore the influence of mergers on bars, we construct a suite of \\textit{N}-body merger pairs where a Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus-like radially biased satellite disk galaxy merges with a central disk galaxy during its bar formation. With the central galaxy fixed, the satellite varies in merger parameters: the mass ratio $m/M$ relative to the central galaxy, the impact parameter $b$, and the orbital inclination angle $θ_i$ relative to the central disk. We find that the bar survival probability decreases with increasing $m/M$. Mergers with $m/M\\lesssim1/10$ generally preserve the forming bar, whereas those with ${m/M}\\geq1/2$ tend to destroy it, producing more early-type-like remnants. For intermediate mass ratios ($1/5 \\leq m/M \\leq 1/3$), several models yield ``weakening bars'', in which the bar survives the merger but gradually decays during subsequent secular evolution, possibly due to interactions between nested double bars formed from merger debris. In contrast to $m/M$, $b$ and $θ_i$ have only secondary and stochastic effects on bar survival. The different influences of these three merger parameters can be naturally explained by the tidal force exerted by the satellite on the forming bar, which tends to weaken the bar when the satellite crosses it nearly perpendicular to its major axis."}

For FLRW cosmologies, we demonstrate that Gauss-Bonnet terms can replace the Big Bang/Crunch with a \"sudden\" singularity, characterized by a finite scale factor and Hubble rate but diverging higher-order derivatives. Investigating various branches of solutions shows the possibility of explicit extension of non-spacelike geodesics beyond the singular point. Furthermore, we employ the Gauss-Bonnet junction conditions to verify the consistency of the extension with the field equations. The whole solution describes a contracting phase prior to the expansion phase with a well-defined surface stress-energy tensor. Regarding the Boulware-Deser black hole, we find that Gauss-Bonnet terms soften the central singularity for radial geodesics--rendering them \"weak\" according to the Tipler and Krolak criteria--whereas non-radial geodesics remain strongly singular. Junction condition analysis of this solution shows that although higher-curvature corrections alter the nature of the singularity, geodesics are still inextendible as a result of divergent extrinsic curvature. Our results are consistent with the Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems since in Gauss-Bonnet black holes, geodesics suffer from focusing (expansion parameter diverges), while in cosmology, there is no focusing since the expansion parameter remains finite at the singularity."}

Within a unified dynamical framework, we analyze test-particle motion in a broad class of dark-matter-embedded geometries, including singular black holes, regular black holes, naked singularities, and Einstein-cluster configurations. We show that environmental perturbations generically break integrability in the strong-field regime, giving rise to chaotic motion whose onset, duration, and termination depend sensitively on horizon structure, core regularization, and matter distribution. Using the numerical Kludge approach, we demonstrate that chaotic trajectories produce systematic qualitative modifications of the emitted gravitational radiation, such as irregular amplitude modulation and loss of phase coherence, in contrast to the smooth, quasi-periodic waveforms generated by regular motion. Our results establish the robustness of chaos in environmentally perturbed EMRIs and provide a clear conceptual link between nonlinear orbital dynamics, spacetime structure, and observable gravitational-wave signatures."}

By adjusting some parameters, we investigate the sensitivity of the simulation results of the H2O ice on the removal of reaction-diffusion competition, the removal of non-diffusive chemistry, and the desorption energies of the suprathermal species. We find the model, with a few adjustments of the chemistry, can reproduce the steady-state [H2O2]/[H2O] and [O3]/[O2]_0 abundance ratios in the H2O and O2 radiolysis experiments at any CR flux in the experiments. These adjustments in the model do not fully reproduce the fluence required to reach the steady state. It tends also to overestimate the destruction of H2O as measured in H2O radiolysis experiments. We show that reducing the G-values of H2O radiolysis, which implies an increase in the efficiency of immediate reformation of water locally after ion impact, leads to simulated H2O destruction rates closer to the experiments. The effect of reaction-diffusion competition on the simulation results of H2O ice is significant at $ζ\\lesssim 10^{-14}\\ \\rm s^{-1}$.

As a concrete application, we examine a binary black hole system and show how Lorentz violation alters the observed strain through shifted retarded times, amplitude rescaling, and higher derivative corrections to the quadrupole formula. The CPT-odd term produces characteristic attenuation and distortions in the waveform, which can be interpreted as energy exchange between the gravitational wave and the Lorentz-violating background rather than a violation of energy conservation.

We uncover a $f_{merg}$-$f_{AGN}$ relation with two regimes: $f_{merg}$ stays roughly flat for less-dominant AGN ($f_{AGN}<0.8$) but increases at $f_{AGN}>0.8$ for the MIR and X-ray AGN, and more gently for SED AGN, where mergers appear to be the main triggering mechanism. Additionally, $f_{merg}$ increases monotonically as a function of L$_{disc}$, for all AGN types, reaching $f_{merg}>50\\%$ for the most luminous AGN (L$_{disc} \\gtrsim 10^{46}\\,{erg\\,s^{-1}}$). Overall, our results suggest that major mergers can trigger AGN out to the cosmic noon at $z\\sim2$. Furthermore, the role of major mergers shows a clear dependence on AGN luminosity and remains the principal mechanism for fuelling the most powerful AGN."}

Here we develop a conformal formulation of black-hole perturbation theory based on the CEFEs and derive the conformal Teukolsky equation. Starting from a transparent review of Friedrich's regularisation strategy, this work establishes a direct connection between mainstream curvature-based linear perturbation theory and conformal formulations of general relativity. This perspective is timely given the growing relevance of hyperboloidal frameworks in black-hole perturbation theory, where conformal compactification is introduced at the level of an already linearised effective wave equation. Here instead, the conformal factor is a dynamical variable within the field equations. In the non-linear equations there is a coupling between conformal and curvature perturbations; however, when linearised around a Petrov-type D background, the conformal factor decouples from the equations governing the Newman-Penrose components $φ_0$ and $φ_4$ of the rescaled Weyl tensor. The resulting equation preserves the structural form of the classical Teukolsky equation while remaining regular at the conformal boundary. This provides a geometric interpretation of the hyperboloidal master variable and an entry point into the CEFE framework. We further derive the conformal Teukolsky equation for a conformal representation of Kerr spacetime where spatial infinity is realised as a blown-up cylinder. By bridging conformal and traditional approaches to black-hole perturbation theory, the framework highlights a geometrically regular representation of perturbative dynamics that may inform extensions beyond the linear regime."}

In this study, we utilise the IllustrisTNG simulation suite to investigate the statistical relationship between the splashback and shock surfaces in a sample of 812 cluster-mass halos. We compute the full angular distribution of both boundaries and examine their relationship, also considering how different moments of this distribution correlate with halo properties. We employ a dispersion-based measure for the splashback boundary and the maximum entropy distance for the shock location. Despite examining various boundary definitions, we consistently observe an offset between the splashback and shock boundaries, with $R_{\\rm sh}/R_{\\rm sp} \\sim 1.3-2$, depending on specific methodological choices. This offset predominantly occurs along void directions. We analyse the redshift evolution of these boundaries for a subset of halos and find that splashback and shock boundaries are not necessarily distinct at earlier times. During mergers, gas dissipates energy and resists contraction via pressure, unlike collisionless dark matter, leading to the observed boundary offset. We also find that the feature in pressure profiles arising from the outer accretion shock is sensitive to the exact method of stacking, which has important implications for observations."}

Within a unified dynamical framework, we analyze test-particle motion in a broad class of dark-matter-embedded geometries, including singular black holes, regular black holes, naked singularities, and Einstein-cluster configurations. We show that environmental perturbations generically break integrability in the strong-field regime, giving rise to chaotic motion whose onset, duration, and termination depend sensitively on horizon structure, core regularization, and matter distribution. Using the numerical Kludge approach, we demonstrate that chaotic trajectories produce systematic qualitative modifications of the emitted gravitational radiation, such as irregular amplitude modulation and loss of phase coherence, in contrast to the smooth, quasi-periodic waveforms generated by regular motion.

In K-essence cosmology, the scalar field induces an emergent FLRW geometry that is disformally linked to the gravitational metric, resulting in a \\emph{tilted causal structure} where the light cone propagation differs from that of gravity. This study develops a covariant Boltzmann formalism inside a homogeneous K-essence framework and derives the modified mass-shell condition, geodesic equations, and collision integrals for both massless and massive particles. We demonstrate that the photon distribution retains its thermal properties in the emergent frame, while it seems geometrically rescaled in the gravitational frame. The Thomson and Compton processes maintain their microscopic structure while obtaining effective masses and interaction rates governed by the scalar field. During the tightly coupled epoch, the photon-baryon fluid experiences acoustic oscillations characterized by a modified sound horizon. For the kinetic K-essence DBI-type Lagrangian, the interaction rate scales as $n_{e}σ_{T}^{\\rm eff}a\\propto a^{-8}$, indicating a strong coupling in the early universe.

In our setup, the running parameter $α$ is fixed to a negative value by matching the effective Newtonian potential to the one-loop EFT result. As a consequence, the associated running Newton coupling does not realise the ultraviolet fixed point of asymptotically safe gravity, and the geometry should be interpreted as an SDG-inspired effective metric rather than a realisation of asymptotically safe gravity itself. We focus on the resulting renormalisation-group-improved Schwarzschild metric, which naturally yields a finite-size Planck-density core. Building on this background, we compute the QNM spectrum for scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations using the Spectral Method (SM). This approach, known for its superior accuracy over high-order WKB schemes, enables the detection of fundamental modes, large families of overtones, and purely imaginary overdamped modes that are entirely missed in previous analysis. Our results reveal a robust Martini glass morphology of the oscillatory spectrum across perturbation sectors, nearly equally spaced overdamped modes with characteristic anomalous gaps, and the emergence, in the gravitational sector, of isolated overdamped modes separated from the main sequence by exceptionally large frequency intervals.

In particular, on the sphere, our results reveal phenomena that contrast with the well-known achievements on compact manifolds without conformal Killing vector fields, including nonexistence of solutions in the near-CMC regime and instability when the mean curvature is non-constant. By contrast, on Euclidean or hyperbolic manifolds, the equations are always solvable, with all expected properties of solutions satisfied. These findings support the view that, although the conformal method appears to present some drawbacks on compact manifolds, it remains a promising tool for parametrizing solutions to the constraint equations on asymptotically flat and hyperbolic manifolds in arbitrary mean curvature regimes.\n  In this article, we also investigate the sign of mass, showing that the ADM and asymptotically hyperbolic mass can take arbitrary sign when the decay rate of symmetric $(0,2)$-tensor $k$ at infinity is critical. Finally, most solution classes in our framework are explicit, providing a variety of models in general relativity and offering insights into the structure and behavior of initial data, particularly in numerical applications."}

When the bare cosmological constant is precisely fine-tuned to $Λ= 1/(8α)$, the scalar curvature is fixed such that the derivative $f'(R)=1+2αR$ identically vanishes, demonstrating that the family represents a pathological $R_0$-degenerate boundary of the viable physical states. This mathematical degeneracy decouples the modified field equations, permitting the existence of an arbitrary $1/r^2$ integration constant in the metric, which functions as a purely geometric, Reissner-Nordström hair mimicker. However, any infinitesimal deviation from this exact boundary instantaneously destroys the degeneracy, rigorously forcing the geometric hair to vanish and collapsing the spacetime back into the standard Schwarzschild-de Sitter family. We provide the exact algebraic derivation of this spacetime and highlight its physical pathologies, including the identically vanishing Wald entropy of the associated black hole horizons, the divergence of the effective gravitational coupling, the resulting backreaction catastrophe, and the onset of severe ghost instabilities. Ultimately, this exact solution functions as a rigorous no-go theorem within the Starobinsky model, pedagogically illustrating the extreme fragility and physical hostility of degenerate, purely mathematical solutions in highly non-linear $f(R)$ gravity theories."}

Cosmological Constraints with Simulation-Based Priors", "comment": "24 pages, 8 figures, 9 tables", "summary": "We analyze the public DESI full-shape clustering data using simulation-based priors (SBPs). Our priors are obtained by fitting normalizing flows to the distribution of EFT parameters measured from field-level simulations, themselves generated using tailored halo occupation distribution (HOD) models for each tracer. Incorporating SBPs in a power spectrum analysis significantly enhances $Λ$CDM cosmological parameter constraints; in combination with BAO information from DESI DR2 and a BBN prior on the baryon density, we find the matter density parameter $Ω_m=0.2987\\pm 0.0066$, the Hubble constant $H_0=68.80\\pm 0.35\\,\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude $σ_8 = 0.766\\pm 0.015$ (or the lensing parameter $S_8=0.764\\pm 0.018$), which are $1\\%$, $40\\%$ and $50\\%$ stronger than the baseline results, though with a notable downwards shift in $σ_8$. The SBPs also have a significant impact in extended models, with the dark energy figure-of-merit improving by $70\\%$ ($20\\%$) in a $w_0w_a$CDM analysis when combining with the CMB (and supernovae). In the SBP analysis, we do not find statistically significant evidence for dynamical dark energy: the equation of state parameters are consistent with a cosmological constant within $2.2σ$ ($1.4σ$) in analyses without (with) supernovae. The neutrino mass constraints are also enhanced, with the $95\\%$ limits $M_ν<0.073\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $M_ν<0.090\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ in $Λ$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM respectively. The latter is the strongest constraint obtained to date and reinforces the preference for the normal neutrino mass hierarchy, regardless of the background dynamics. While our results are sensitive to HOD modeling assumptions, they clearly demonstrate that the inclusion of small-scale information can significantly sharpen cosmological parameter constraints."}

Published in Physics Letters B ( 2026)", "summary": "This work examines the cosmological implications of two functional forms of $f(R,T) = R + αT^n$ gravity: for two different value of $n $ where $n=1$ and $n\\neq 1$, and $α$ and $n$ are free parameters. The modified Friedmann equations are derived, and the cosmic evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ is determined. Cosmological parameters are estimated through $χ^2$ minimization and MCMC analysis using the emcee algorithm, with model parameters constrained by various observational datasets. Both models reproduce late-time acceleration and remain observationally indistinguishable from $Λ$CDM, while allowing small deviations parameterized by $α$ and $n$. The cosmological behavior of the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, the jerk, the snap parameter $s(z)$, and the effective equation of state parameter $ω$ is also analyzed. The results indicate that the Universe transitioned from deceleration to late-time accelerated expansion, consistent with the $Λ$CDM model. Analysis of the energy conditions reveals that the NEC and DEC are satisfied, while the SEC is violated, which explains the transition from a decelerating matter-dominated epoch to the present accelerated phase. These findings indicate that the proposed $f(R,T)$ models are compatible with current observational data and provide a viable alternative to $Λ$CDM in describing cosmic acceleration."}

Assuming a kination epoch in the early Universe, we analytically derive constraints on initial conditions that are consistent with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the current dark energy density. Compared to the severe 120-digit fine-tuning required for dark energy to be a cosmological constant, our result suggests that the degree of fine-tuning is naturally relaxed by dozens of orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we discuss the method for testing this model through future observations of the gravitational wave background."}

For this stellar orbits in the nuclear star cluster are reliable probes. We investigate different dark matter mass profiles through pericentre shift of stellar orbits near the black hole. We also study capability of existing and upcoming astrometric facilities to detect dark matter induced precession and to distinguish between several dark matter profiles. Parameters of different dark matter density profiles are estimated by using the most recent upper bound on dark mass near the black hole. These profiles are then used for calculating the gravitational potential and hence the relativistic pericentre shift of both low and high eccentricity orbits of 13 S-stars. We use the recently measured deviation parameter $f_{sp}$ for investigating competition between dark matter and gravitational physics within S2's orbit. The astrometric shift of the pericentres has been calculated and compared with existing and upcoming astrometric capabilities of large and extremely large telescopes. The orbit of S2 is found to be insensitive to dark matter induced precession. Low eccentricity and wider orbits are prominent probes for measuring dark matter induced precession which is accessible to present and upcoming astrometric facilities such as Keck, GRAVITY and TMT. The existing and upcoming facilities can distinguish between different dark matter profiles for some stars and hence they posses the capability to distinguish between possible formation histories of the central region of our Galaxy."}

We investigate their production in Rastall gravity, a modification of general relativity that introduces a non-minimal coupling between matter and geometry through the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor. Analyz- ing cosmological perturbations during radiation domination, we demonstrate that the Rastall parameter fundamentally alters the collapse dynamics, modifying the growth of density fluctuations, the critical threshold for black hole formation, and the fluctuation amplitude at horizon crossing. Current cosmological constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background, and large-scale structure restrict the Rastall parameter to small values, yet within this allowed range PBH production can be altered by orders of magnitude compared to general relativity. Our results establish primordial black holes as novel probes of modified gravity."}
