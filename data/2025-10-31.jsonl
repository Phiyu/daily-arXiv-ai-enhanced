Moreover, we prove that type II QTGs possess\nsecond-order equations on general spherical backgrounds.

Spiral features appear across stellar\npopulations of different ages, confirming their density-wave nature and\nproducing coherent spirals in both metallicity and mean stellar age\ndistributions-consistent with recent Gaia observations of the Milky Way.

We present a new method designed to give access to\nthe LoS distribution of the dust emission, both in terms of intensity and\npolarization. Methods. We relied on three kinematic gas tracers (HI, 12CO, and\n13CO emission lines) to identify the different clouds present along the LoS.

It is shown that the velocities $f_R$ and $f_\\theta$ can have both\nthe same and different signs. Therefore, we obtained a large scatter of\nestimates. Thus, if $f_R$ and $f_\\theta$ have the same signs, then\n$\\Omega_p=25.8\\pm2.0$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ and $R_{cor}=9.1\\pm0.8$ kpc.

The simulations include detailed modeling of star formation, chemical\nenrichment, and supernova feedback using the \\textsc{CELib} and\n\\textsc{grackle} libraries, achieving baryonic resolutions of\n$\\sim2\\times10^3\\,M_\\odot$. Our study focuses on how assembly history governs\nthe structural and kinematic diversity of dwarf galaxies within the\n$\\Lambda$CDM framework. The simulated galaxies reproduce the observed\nstellar-to-halo mass, mass--metallicity, and size--mass relations, yielding\nstellar masses of $10^6-10^8\\,M_\\odot$ and metallicities consistent with those\nof Local Group dwarf galaxies. The galaxies display a broad range of rotational\nsupport, where gas is generally more rotationally supported than stars.\nDifferences in morphology and kinematics primarily reflect variations in halo\nassembly timescales and merger activity. Early-assembling, high-concentration\nhalos form stars efficiently and become gas-poor by $z=0$, while\nlate-assembling, low-concentration halos remain gas-rich due to delayed star\nformation and rejuvenated gas accretion. We identify a clear anti-correlation\nbetween rotational support and the cumulative merger mass fraction,\ndemonstrating that dynamical heating by mergers is the dominant factor shaping\nkinematic diversity. In some cases, late-time mergers induce the formation of\nextended gas disks by delivering fresh gas and angular momentum. These results\ndemonstrate that assembly history, rather than halo mass alone, critically\nshapes the present-day kinematic and morphological diversity of dwarf galaxies."}

These\nphenomena are intrinsically linked to the physical conditions of the medium,\nwhich is permeated by magnetic (B) fields affecting its transport and dynamics.\nHere, we spatially resolve, $0.24$\" (96 pc), the B-fields in the dusty and\nmolecular outflows of Arp 220, the closest ($78$ Mpc) Ultra-Luminous Infrared\nGalaxy hosting two interacting nuclei, denoted as East and West. We perform\nALMA $870~\\mu$m dust continuum polarization and CO(3-2) emission line\npolarization, and report the first detection of CO(3-2) emission line\npolarization through the Goldreich-Kylafis effect in an outflow. Dust\npolarization shows that Arp 220 E has a spiral-like B-field on the disk with a\nlinear polarization fraction of $0.4\\pm0.1$% that may produce the detected\ncircular polarization passing through foreground aligned dust grains. Arp 220 W\nreveals a B-field parallel to the red- and blueshifted outflows in both the\ndust and emission line polarization maps. The outflows show a dust polarization\nof $0.2$%, while the CO(3-2) emission line polarization is $1-2$% at\n$4-6\\sigma$ significance across independent velocity channels. A highly\npolarized ($3-5$%) dusty bridge has a B-field orientation of $\\sim110^{\\circ}$\nconnecting both nuclei. Mean B-field strengths of $1.6$ mG and $8$ mG for the\nblue- and redshifted outflows, respectively, are estimated. These strong\nB-fields are attributed to amplification by compression in nuclear clouds and\nsupernova remnants. This amplified B-field is likely sustained by the turbulent\nkinetic energy in the outflow and may be critical in directing the transport of\nmetals and cosmic rays into the circumgalactic medium."}

In contrast, [Eu/Mg] is enhanced by about +0.5 dex at all [Fe/H],\nsignificantly above the values observed in Milky Way stars, where [Eu/Mg]\nremains close to solar, reflecting comparable production of r-process and\n$\\alpha$-capture elements. Moreover, [Ba/Eu] increases with metallicity,\nbeginning at [Fe/H] $\\approx$ -1.5 dex, namely at a lower metallicity with\nrespect to the Milky Way, where [Ba/Eu] starts to increase around [Fe/H]\n$\\approx$ -1 dex.

We use\nthe database constructed in Wasleske & Baldassare (2024) which contains dwarf\ngalaxies that were selected as active galaxies by optical spectroscopy,\ninfrared colors, X-ray brightness, and photometric variability.\nMulti-wavelength archival data was used to consistently apply all of these\nmethods to every galaxy within this compiled set. The cross application of\nthese methods resulted in a diversity of sub-populations identified as active\nby some set of these techniques. In this paper, we estimate host galaxy\nproperties from spectral energy distribution models. We connect the active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) signatures to our estimated host galaxies' properties\nusing statistical dimensionality reduction methods. We find that dwarf AGN\nselected by infrared colors are the most distinct population, with the highest\nstar formation rates and lowest stellar masses. We also find some other key\npopulation differences, such as the broad line AGN having significantly higher\nAGN luminosities. X-ray and variability selected AGN have higher average star\nformation rates than those selected with optical narrow line spectroscopic\ndiagrams. Our connections to the host galaxy parameters potentially point to\nthe sub-populations representing different epochs of the evolution of\naccretion."}
