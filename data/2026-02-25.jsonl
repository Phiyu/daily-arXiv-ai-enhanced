ACES provides the first large-scale, high-resolution ($\\sim2.5$\") view of the central $\\sim200$ parsecs of the Milky Way.

In the combined mosaic of 45 individual ALMA mosaics, the typical RMS noise achieved is $\\sim0.1$ mJy per $\\sim2.5$\" beam, though there is a tail of substantially higher noise toward regions with bright continuum structure, especially around Sgr A* and Sgr B2. In-band spectral indices are measurable for a small fraction of the brightest and most compact sources, enabling distinction between dust-dominated and free-free- or synchrotron-dominated sources. To recover emission on large angular scales, we present the GBT MUSTANG-2 Three millimeter Extended Nucleus Survey (TENS), a new 10\"resolution survey of the CMZ, which we combine with the ACES image by feathering. To demonstrate the quality and reliability of the ACES data, we compare to previously-published ALMA data obtained with higher resolution and sensitivity, finding overall good agreement with past results, but some disagreement toward the brightest sources."}

The exchange of metals from the interstellar medium (ISM) to the circumgalactic medium (CGM) are caused by the formation, feedback, and/or merging history of galaxies. We study the variation in chemical composition between the ISM ($\\lesssim3\\,$kpc) and CGM ($\\sim5-10\\,$kpc) for a sample of $M_{\\star}>10^{9.5}\\,M_{\\odot}$ main-sequence galaxies at $4<z<6$ with both JWST and ALMA observations. Using JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy, we derive the optical line ratios from the ISM and the CGM for our sample focusing on the typical optical lines used for metallicity studies. Our comparison shows that the ISM and the CGM have similar chemical abundances. This indicates that the CGM of these typical $4<z<6$ galaxies is enriched to the level of their ISM in the early universe. Using statistical tests, we find that some of the line ratios show marginal differences between the ISM and CGM. Combined with \\texttt{Cloudy} modeling, our results suggest that a difference in ionization level (higher for the ISM) is the dominant reason for the observed ratio difference of oxygen line ratios. There is also indication of a deficit in the nitrogen abundance with respect to oxygen in the CGM, which suggests a delay in redistribution of secondary nitrogen. Finally, an enhanced $F_{[\\rm CII]\\rm 158μm}/F_{\\rm Hα}$ ratio is observed in the CGM, suggesting that feedback and/or mergers play a key role in metal mixing."}

Four additional stacks for subsamples defined by optical-to-UV luminosity ratios show that LRDs form a heterogeneous population spanning diverse continuum slopes and line properties. Assuming LRDs host super-massive black holes (BHs) surrounded by dense gas clouds, and stars accompany this core, we infer masses of $M_{BH}\\sim10^{6.0-6.5}$~M$_\\odot$ and $M_\\bigstar\\sim10^{8.3}$ M$_\\odot$, corresponding to BH-to-stellar mass ratios of 1-2%. The stacks show ubiquitous UV and optical FeII emission, indicating a direct view of the broad-line region and high (but sub-Eddington) accretion ($λ_{Edd}=0.6\\pm0.2$). We find a significant stellar contribution in the far-UV, reaching $\\sim80$% in the bluest systems. Possible Wolf-Rayet features (HeII$λ$4687, nitrogen lines) are identified, tracing a young (3-7 Myr) compact starburst event.

Geometry-only and geometry+morphology methods provide modest gains over the reconstruction baseline, and contrastive variants do not show stable improvement. Likelihood scoring on AE latents is consistently stronger: across three seeds, latent-only likelihood reaches ROC-AUC $0.8555\\pm 0.0181$ and PR-AUC $0.9219 \\pm 0.0118$, versus ROC-AUC $0.7663 \\pm 0.0450$ and PR-AUC $0.8667 \\pm 0.0255$ for AE+manifold.

Accepted for publication in ApJS", "summary": "Stellar halos are the only major stellar component of disk galaxies that lack systematic observational characterization, yet they encode critical information about galaxy merger histories. We present the first systematic census of stellar halos in a large, flux-limited sample of 169 high-inclination central galaxies with stellar masses 7.3 <= log Mstar/Msun <= 11.0 and redshift z < 0.1, using HSC-SSP Deep optical images. Stellar halos are detected in 93 galaxies, primarily through their low isophotal ellipticities in the outskirts, improving upon conventional methods of stellar halo identification. The halo detection rate reaches ~ 50% at log Mstar/Msun > 9.9 and >= 70% for Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies. We derive halo surface brightness profiles, colors, and masses, finding that stellar halos generally follow power-law radial profiles. Higher-mass galaxies, on average, exhibit smaller power-law indices and larger halo mass fractions, indicating more extended halos and more active merger histories. A significant stellar halo color-mass correlation, driven mainly by the mass-metallicity relation, suggests dominance by a few massive accretion events. MW-mass galaxies have a median stellar halo fraction of 10% +/- 5%. Among nearby galaxies with halo measurements within 25 Mpc, two thirds (including the MW) lie below the mean stellar halo fraction-galaxy mass relation. Overall, the nearby galaxies show a median halo deficit of ~ 0.3 dex, implying unusually quiescent merger histories. We show that this deficit follows a broader trend in which typical halo fractions increase with heliocentric distance, tracking the gradual rise in matter density toward the cosmic average by z <= 0.07."}

In this article, we explore particle creation driven by radial oscillations of 3+1-dimensional spherically symmetric compact objects, such as neutron stars, using a massless, minimally coupled scalar field as a reference model. We employ a toy model to describe the oscillatory dynamics and its coupling to the field modes, focusing on the resulting effects in the exterior spacetime of the star. The Bogoliubov coefficients relating the in and out vacua are computed non-perturbatively using high-precision numerical methods, without relying on weak-field, small-amplitude or small-velocity expansions. This allows us to determine the full particle spectrum and the total particle number in the strong-field and fully relativistic regime. Our analysis confirms the existence of particle creation in this setting and, crucially, reveals a distinct resonance structure in the spectrum."}

While this region is well documented to have extreme gas properties that clearly distinguish it from the rest of the Galaxy, the properties of the bulk molecular gas at high angular resolution are relatively unexplored. Band 3 data from the ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array) large program ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) reveal the highly filamentary nature of CMZ molecular gas at high resolution (3\" or 0.1pc) across the entire CMZ. Visual inspection of these data suggests that there are at least two general classes of elongated structures, which we identify as: i) large-scale (10 pc) filamentary structures (LFs) and ii) a ubiquitous population of small-scale (about 1 pc) filamentary structures (SFs). We present detailed morphological and kinematic properties towards three structures in each category, as well as their association with magnetic fields and the correlation of HNCO 4(0,4)-3(0,3) with other molecular species. Our investigation reveals that these structures are largely coherent in position-position-velocity space. The alignment with the magnetic field structure is mixed, with some parallel, some perpendicular, and some intermediate alignments. We find that LFs likely trace pieces of contiguous CMZ orbital structures and are a manifestation of global CMZ dynamics. The second class, SFs, are pervasive and may be the result of complicated turbulence and shearing dynamics in the CMZ gas flows, as seen in numerical simulations."}

We analyze the hyperbolicity of this model coupled to Einstein field equations using a newly developed technique that allows for hyperbolicity studies without explicit first order reduction. Furthermore, we identify a frame choice where our formulation is causal, stable and with positive entropy generation for a wide range of equations of state (EoS). Our analysis shows that the inclusion of an out-of-equilibrium correction to the charge current, plays an important role in guaranteeing the strong hyperbolicity and, therefore, the well-posedness of the system.

ULPT reorganizes the standard Lagrangian approach by separating the Jacobian deviation, which generates the nonlinear source bispectrum, from the displacement-mapping effect that determines how long-wavelength bulk flows distort observed configurations. Within this structure, we derive general one-loop ULPT expressions for the bispectrum and analyze their infrared (IR) behavior, demonstrating exact, nonperturbative IR cancellation and the natural emergence of an IR-resummed description of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) damping. In particular, ULPT enables a detailed and fully analytic treatment of the wiggle-wiggle contribution to the IR-resummed bispectrum, whose structure has remained comparatively unexplored in previous approaches. We further construct IR-resummed models for the cross bispectra of all pre- and post-reconstruction combinations. For configurations in which the displacement fields differ, ULPT captures not only the overall exponential damping but also the more intricate BAO-scale modulation characteristic of mixed pre/post bispectra. Our results clarify the physical origin of nonlinear BAO suppression and provide a compact theoretical framework in which the full ULPT bispectrum, once implemented numerically through displacement-mapping convolution integrals, will automatically encode all nonlinear BAO and IR effects. The framework developed here therefore offers a unified and IR-safe foundation for interpreting next-generation bispectrum measurements."}

Using new Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy, HST/ACS photometry, and orbital modeling, we re-examine the nature of W1. From our updated sample of 57 member stars, we find that past analyses included four binaries and seven non-members, identified here using Gaia proper motions and updated velocities. We continue to find a velocity dispersion consistent with previous analyses, measuring $σ_v = 4.7^{+1.5}_{-1.3}$ km s$^{-1}$ from 49 stars out to $3~r_{\\rm half}$. If W1 is in equilibrium, this suggests a dynamical mass of $5.9^{+3.7}_{-3.4} \\times 10^5~M_{\\odot}$ and a mass-to-light ratio of $(M/L)_V = 660 \\pm 590$.

Focusing on the perihelion precession of Mercury, gravitational redshift, and gravitational light bending, we derive analytical expressions for orbital precession and demonstrate that, with suitable physically acceptable parameters, pseudo-Newtonian approaches can accurately reproduce the observed perihelion advance and gravitational redshift. However, we confirm that no single potential consistently captures all relativistic effects. In particular, while certain parameters yield agreement with general relativity for planetary motion and redshift, they fail to reproduce gravitational lensing over a broad range of impact parameters. Our results highlight both the usefulness and limitations of pseudo-Newtonian methods in modeling gravitational phenomena. Although the pseudo-Newtonian approach cannot serve as universal substitutes for general relativity, especially in strong-field regimes, it provides valuable semi-analytical insight and pedagogical simplicity.

These inferences remain rather stable against variations of the input observable set and parameter space coverage. These results indicate that correlations among intracluster properties contain cosmological information beyond that encoded in the cluster abundance alone, which can be captured by machine learning trained on multi-cosmology simulations. Conclusions: ML algorithms trained on multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations can effectively infer cosmological parameters directly from galaxy cluster data. This is a change of paradigm in the context of cosmological parameter inferences. This approach complements traditional cluster-count analyses and is particularly suited to large upcoming surveys, where systematic uncertainties in mass calibration may otherwise dominate the error budget. It also highlights the potential of large-scale X-ray surveys to deliver independent tests of the standard cosmological model."}

We present an overview of the molecular line data processing for ACES and describe the first data release. We showcase the HNCO (4-3) and HCO$^{+}$ (1-0) data, which were targeted at high spectral resolution (0.2 km s$^{-1}$) to trace the kinematics of the molecular gas in the CMZ. The HNCO and HCO$^{+}$ maps are compared with previous single-dish CMZ surveys and discrete ALMA observations of CMZ clouds to demonstrate the quality of the data. We highlight the ubiquity of parsec-scale, linear absorption features traced by HCO$^{+}$. Their origin is unknown, and ACES provides the first opportunity to study these enigmatic features throughout the CMZ. We release the HNCO and HCO$^{+}$ cubes for all 45 ACES fields, along with the full cube mosaics which combine all fields into a contiguous mosaic of the CMZ. We additionally provide advanced products of these full mosaics, including integrated and peak intensity, noise, and position-velocity maps. These products provide substantial legacy value for the community, offering an unparalleled view of the physical and kinematic structure of the dense gas in the CMZ."}

The motivation is to enable realistic accretion disk studies in MGR, where full relativistic MHD simulations remain computationally prohibitive. Effective potentials and the underlying Newtonian-like forces are derived for both massive and massless particles in the equatorial plane, relevant for disk dynamics. The reliability of the PNP is tested by comparing key orbital properties -- marginally stable, marginally bound, photon orbits and energies at marginally stable orbit radii -- with exact MGR predictions. The PNP reproduces the marginally stable and photon orbits exactly, while marginally bound orbits and specific energies deviate by less than about 7-10%. The influence of the MGR parameter on particle dynamics and effective potentials is analyzed, revealing non-trivial departures from simple Newtonian intuition. The study demonstrates that the proposed PNP accurately captures essential spatial properties of MGR spacetime and provides an efficient, physically consistent tool for investigating accretion phenomena and strong-gravity astrophysics beyond general relativity."}

Unlike standard mechanisms relying on classical dynamics or modified actions, this enhancement originates from the reduced density matrix of the observable sector after tracing over a hidden gravitational reservoir. This framework allows for a sizable tensor-to-scalar ratio r > 0.01 consistent with sub-Planckian inflaton excursions, providing a purely quantum mechanical evasion of the Lyth bound. The resulting mixed state leaves a distinctive \"quantum birthmark\" in the form of oscillatory features in the power spectrum and a characteristic violation of the single-field consistency relation, manifesting as a scale-dependent enhancement of the squeezed-limit bispectrum. Furthermore, we forecast that this entanglement may manifest as a late-time stochastic noise enhancement in gravitational wave interferometers, offering a novel experimental window into the quantum nature of spacetime."}

Connecting X-ray variability with AGN physical properties and a new path to Cosmological distances", "comment": "accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "X-ray variability is a well-established characteristic of active galactic nuclei (AGN), known to correlate inversely with both the supermassive black hole mass and luminosity, although the degree of each remains a topic of debate. The potential of X-ray variability as a proxy for MBH or for intrinsic LX has led to proposals to use AGN as standard candles to test cosmological models. However, the large intrinsic dispersion in these relations has limited their practical applications. In this work, we investigate the dependence of X-ray variability on AGN physical properties using a sample of 134 Seyfert 1 galaxies from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), which is the largest sample to date, more than three times larger than those used in previous studies. Contrary to earlier findings, we observe that X-ray variability correlates with luminosity just as strongly as with MBH. Furthermore, we still do not find evidence for the expected anti-correlation between variability and Eddington ratio, even when using refined bolometric luminosities from SED fitting to compute the Eddington ratio. From a cosmological perspective, the increased sample size reduces the scatter in the log(L)-log(exvar) relation to ~0.63 dex - a significant improvement over previous results, but still too large to serve as competitive standard candles, when compared to SNIa (uncertainties on distances of ~5-10%) or the L(X)-L(UV) relation in quasars (uncertainties of 10-12%). We tested including the width of broad emission lines as additional parameters, but found that this does not significantly lower the observed dispersion, contrary to previous studies on smaller samples. Finally, we discuss how future X-ray missions such as AXIS and NewAthena will improve this scenario by enabling precise variability measurements for thousands of AGN up to redshift z~3, thereby enabling it as a new cosmological probe."}

Here we investigate a novel quantum probe of strong-field gravity: the gravitomagnetic Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect for Cooper pairs propagating in Kerr spacetime. The frame-dragging induced by a rotating black hole (BH) generates an effective vector potential through the off-diagonal metric component $g_{tφ}$, which couples to the macroscopic phase of the superconducting condensate. We derive the gauge-invariant AB phase shift $Δθ= (4πm^* Ma/\\hbar)(1/r_2 - 1/r_1)$ for an interferometer with arms at radii $r_1$ and $r_2$, where $m^* = 2m_e$ is the Cooper pair mass and $a$ is the BH spin parameter.

Although direct experimental realization remains beyond current technology due to the vast distances involved, our framework provides quantitative predictions linking quantum coherence to spacetime curvature, complementing recent observations of gravitational AB phases in atom interferometry."}

To study non-trivial topologies in detail, simulations that natively adopt such geometries are required. Cosmological $N$-body simulations typically evolve matter in a periodic cubic box. While numerically convenient, this imposes a non-trivial 3-torus topology that affects long-range gravitational forces, potentially biasing large-scale statistics. We introduce a compactified simulation framework that is only periodic along a single axis, while having infinite topology with isotropic boundary conditions towards the perpendicular directions, i.e. an $\\mathrm{S}^1\\times\\mathbb{R}^2$ (\"slab\") topology. This new simulation geometry is ideal for simulating systems with cylindrical symmetries like filaments or certain anisotropic cosmological models. We compactify comoving space via inverse stereographic projection along the radial direction of a periodic cylinder, and evolve particles with Newtonian dynamics. A smoothly varying spatial and mass resolution with radius suppresses edge artefacts at the free outer boundary. Our implementation in the StePS (STEreographically Projected cosmological Simulations) framework uses a direct $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ force calculation that maps efficiently to GPUs, and Octree $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log N)$ force calculation that can be used on large CPU-clusters. The cylindrical domain's topology enables fully self-consistent simulations in the $\\mathrm{S}^1\\times\\mathbb{R}^2$ manifold and mitigates periodic-image artefacts for targets whose symmetries are mismatched to a cubic box. The main trade-off is radially varying resolution with distinct systematics and analysis requirements. We demonstrate the accuracy of the new simulation method in a standard $Λ$CDM cosmological simulation."}

We carried out a comparison of redshifts from different sources and excluded some objects with redshifts derived from low-resolution spectra. We derive the reddening for them from the color excess with respect to dereddened counterparts with similar redshifts in the field. Comparisons of our reddenings with M31 reddening maps found no significant correlations. Most QSOs behind M31 show low reddening and do not probe high-extinctions underlining the need to identify fainter quasars behind nearby galaxies, especially behind higher extinction regions -- probably due to a bias towards following up brighter and less extinct candidates. Finally, the redshifts derived from low-resolution spectra must be treated with caution, because they can contain significant errors."}

In this overview paper, we provide the scientific justification for the ACES survey, explain the choice of observational setup, and describe the data legacy products. Finally, we show some of the initial ACES data which highlight the power of ACES' combination of high angular resolution, unprecedented spatial dynamic range, sensitivity, spectral resolution and spectral bandwidth as an illustration of how ACES aims to understand how global processes set the location, intensity, and timescales for star formation and feedback in the CMZ."}

The real part of the potential controls the cosmological background and realizes a plateau-type inflation compatible with $α$-attractor $\\mathrm{T}$-models, while the imaginary part acts as an effective non-Hermitian deformation encoding dissipative effects. Working in the Jordan frame and imposing ghost-free conditions on the effective Planck mass, we derive the background equations and define a complex equation-of-state parameter whose real part governs the expansion and whose imaginary part quantifies departures from conservative dynamics. Numerical integration shows that the duration of inflation is primarily controlled by the nonminimal coupling $ζ$, whereas the complex asymmetry parameter $Δ\\varepsilon$ has a negligible impact on the real background: the real energy density and pressure vary by less than $10^{-5}$ as $Δ\\varepsilon$ is scanned over its allowed range. Mapping the two-field dynamics to an effective single-field description in the Einstein frame, we obtain a spectral index $n_s\\simeq 0.968-0.971$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r<10^{-3}$, fully consistent with Planck 2018 bounds.

Traditional methods frequently necessitate extensive preprocessing, such as starlight subtraction and emission line deblending (e.g., Hα and [N II]), which can introduce substantial biases and uncertainties due to their model-dependent nature. In this work we developed an automated, diagnostic tool capable of distinguishing between star-forming (SF), active galactic nuclei (AGN), low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs), composite, and passive galaxies. We developed a diagnostic tool based on a support vector machine trained on data from optical emission-line ratios and color selection criteria. From literature studies and exploring combinations of discriminatory feature schemes, we found that the equivalent widths of Hβ, [O III]λ5007, and Hα+[N II]λ6548,84 as key diagnostic features. Additionally, galaxies classified as AGN can be distinguished into broad- and narrow-line AGN by measuring the full quarter at the half-maximum of Hα and [N II] complex. We have developed a diagnostic tool that encompasses all activities of galaxies while achieving high performance scores across all of them. Our diagnostic achieves overall accuracy of 83% and recall of 79% for SF, 94% for AGN, 85% for LINER, 77% for composite, and 96% for passive galaxies. Our diagnostic tool significantly improves upon existing diagnostics as it eliminates the need for preprocessing (i.e., starlight subtraction or flux calibration) and spectral line fitting, includes all activity classes under one scheme, and distinguishes the two main AGN types. In addition, omitting starlight subtraction does not significantly reduce performance. Furthermore, Its narrow wavelength requirement enables use across a wide redshift range, making it ideal for high-z studies."}

Working within a local Rindler-wedge framework, we formulate the Clausius relation as the stationarity condition of a Massieu functional at fixed Unruh temperature, which identifies the entropy slope as the parameter controlling the effective gravitational coupling. For area-type entropies with constant slope, the construction reproduces Einstein's equations with $G_{eff} = 1/(4s_0)$, while curvature-dependent entropy densities supplemented by an internal entropy-production term yield the field equations of $f(R)$ gravity.\n  Motivated by group-entropic considerations and long-range correlations, we model the entropy of horizon cross sections by a power law $S(A) = η(A/4G)^δ$ and analyze its local and global implications. To fix the otherwise arbitrary coarse-graining scale entering the entropy slope, we introduce a Topological Calibration Principle that ties the reference area to intrinsic geometric data through the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. For compact two-dimensional sections, this selects a canonical calibration area and leads to a topology-dependent effective coupling $G_{eff}(χ) \\propto |χ|^{1-δ}$ where $χ$ represents the Euler characteristic.

We therefore test whether the data-driven preference for NECB-crossing in CPL reconstructions persists once alternative realizations of phantom behavior are admitted, specifically through sign-switching DE densities. To this end, we introduce and constrain two controlled phenomenological extensions of the CPL framework featuring a negative DE phase in the past. In the CPL$\\to-Λ$ model, the switching epoch is tied to the CPL-inferred NECB-crossing scale factor, yielding an early-time negative cosmological-constant phase, while the post-switch evolution follows the CPL branch. In the sCPL model, the CPL equation of state is maintained at all times, while the sign switch in the energy density occurs at an independent transition redshift. We find that late-time BAO and SNeIa data drive the negative-density phase beyond their effective redshift coverage, and that this requirement is the primary driver of the inferred parameter behavior. While both models are statistically disfavored relative to the baseline CPL, admitting a negative DE phase generally reduces the significance of deviations from a cosmological constant."}

The unique sensitivity and resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provide a fresh way to investigate it. CO$_2$ is typically found in the solid phase (ice) on grain mantles in dense molecular clouds, but is less commonly detected in the gas phase (compared to common molecules such as CO and H$_2$O) and has mostly been found in protostellar and proto-planetary environments. Here, we report and characterize the first observations of gas-phase CO$_2$ absorption toward two IR-bright regions of the Galactic Center, thanks to the high sensitivity of JWST. Using an LTE model we find a CO$_2$ gas excitation temperature between 20 and 50~K, a column density around 2$\\times$10$^{15}$~cm$^{-2}$ and a radial velocity consistent with 0. We also report: 1) simultaneous detections of C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN absorption bands (near 13.7 and 14.0 $μ$m, respectively), with column densitiy ratios of 1:3 and 3:2 with respect to gas-phase CO$_2$, and 2) CO$_2$ ice absorption with a ice-to-gas ratio of 90, consistent with previous findings. We conclude that the absorbing medium is likely in the foreground, most likely from one or more somewhat clumpy cloud(s), located between 0.15 and 4~kpc away from Earth. Additionally, we detected point-like CO$_2$ emission likely associated with a Galactic Center star (IRS~11SW), which is also spatially coincident with a previously reported X-ray source, raising the possibility that the system is a symbiotic binary."}

Starting from the separable Klein-Gordon equation for a massive neutral scalar field, we work in the low-frequency and slow-rotation regime and employ the analytical asymptotic matching (AAM) method to compute the reflection coefficient and the associated superradiant amplification factor. Since an exact global scattering solution is not available in this four-charge geometry, the AAM framework enables a controlled analytic treatment of the near-and far-region dynamics. We provide detailed and systematic derivations of the matching procedure leading to the closed-form amplification formula. The superradiant condition is obtained explicitly and we demonstrate that energy extraction occurs exclusively for co-rotating modes satisfying $Ω< m Ω_H$. We show that the presence of electric and magnetic charges suppresses the amplification relative to the Kerr limit, whereas lighter co-rotating scalar fields broaden the superradiant window and enhance the efficiency of rotational energy extraction."}

Accepted for publication in ApJS", "summary": "Stellar halos are the only major stellar component of disk galaxies that lack systematic observational characterization, yet they encode critical information about galaxy merger histories. We present the first systematic census of stellar halos in a large, flux-limited sample of 169 high-inclination central galaxies with stellar masses 7.3 <= log Mstar/Msun <= 11.0 and redshift z < 0.1, using HSC-SSP Deep optical images. Stellar halos are detected in 93 galaxies, primarily through their low isophotal ellipticities in the outskirts, improving upon conventional methods of stellar halo identification. The halo detection rate reaches ~ 50% at log Mstar/Msun > 9.9 and >= 70% for Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies. We derive halo surface brightness profiles, colors, and masses, finding that stellar halos generally follow power-law radial profiles. Higher-mass galaxies, on average, exhibit smaller power-law indices and larger halo mass fractions, indicating more extended halos and more active merger histories. A significant stellar halo color-mass correlation, driven mainly by the mass-metallicity relation, suggests dominance by a few massive accretion events. MW-mass galaxies have a median stellar halo fraction of 10% +/- 5%. Among nearby galaxies with halo measurements within 25 Mpc, two thirds (including the MW) lie below the mean stellar halo fraction-galaxy mass relation. Overall, the nearby galaxies show a median halo deficit of ~ 0.3 dex, implying unusually quiescent merger histories. We show that this deficit follows a broader trend in which typical halo fractions increase with heliocentric distance, tracking the gradual rise in matter density toward the cosmic average by z <= 0.07."}

Aiming at investigating the true structure of the inner stellar disk, we have developed a comprehensive pipeline for the chronochemical and dynamical analysis of galaxies (Glance: Galactic archaeoLogy via chronochemicAl & dyNamiCal modElling). The presented pipeline employs several state-of-the-art techniques by integrating them into a single, automated pipeline, enabling streamlined analysis of integral-field spectroscopy data, by allowing users to easily and directly extract valuable information on stellar populations, kinematics, dynamics, and gas properties. It automates multiple analysis techniques, including stellar population synthesis (Fado, Starlight, post-processing with RemoveYoung, kinematic extraction (pPXF, Bayes-LOSVD), and dynamical modelling (Dynamite). It handles tasks such as Galactic extinction correction, de-redshifting, Voronoi binning, and nebular continuum correction, while offering extensive customization options. Parallel processing significantly reduces computational time. When applied to MUSE data sampling the central region of NGC 1566, this methodology reveals that its stellar disk significantly deviates from the conventional exponential model, challenging the assumption of universality in disk morphology.

Connecting X-ray variability with AGN physical properties and a new path to Cosmological distances", "comment": "accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "X-ray variability is a well-established characteristic of active galactic nuclei (AGN), known to correlate inversely with both the supermassive black hole mass and luminosity, although the degree of each remains a topic of debate. The potential of X-ray variability as a proxy for MBH or for intrinsic LX has led to proposals to use AGN as standard candles to test cosmological models. However, the large intrinsic dispersion in these relations has limited their practical applications. In this work, we investigate the dependence of X-ray variability on AGN physical properties using a sample of 134 Seyfert 1 galaxies from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), which is the largest sample to date, more than three times larger than those used in previous studies. Contrary to earlier findings, we observe that X-ray variability correlates with luminosity just as strongly as with MBH. Furthermore, we still do not find evidence for the expected anti-correlation between variability and Eddington ratio, even when using refined bolometric luminosities from SED fitting to compute the Eddington ratio. From a cosmological perspective, the increased sample size reduces the scatter in the log(L)-log(exvar) relation to ~0.63 dex - a significant improvement over previous results, but still too large to serve as competitive standard candles, when compared to SNIa (uncertainties on distances of ~5-10%) or the L(X)-L(UV) relation in quasars (uncertainties of 10-12%). We tested including the width of broad emission lines as additional parameters, but found that this does not significantly lower the observed dispersion, contrary to previous studies on smaller samples. Finally, we discuss how future X-ray missions such as AXIS and NewAthena will improve this scenario by enabling precise variability measurements for thousands of AGN up to redshift z~3, thereby enabling it as a new cosmological probe."}

Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics", "summary": "Large dust grains in thermal equilibrium dominate the far-infrared and contribute to the millimetre continuum of star-forming galaxies, but constraining their properties is difficult due to free-free and synchrotron contamination. We study spatial variations in the dust spectral index, mass, and grain properties in the nearby face-on spiral galaxy M 99. We use new 1.15 and 2 mm continuum observations from NIKA2 on the IRAM 30 m telescope (IMEGIN Guaranteed Time Large Programme) combined with multiwavelength data from UV to radio. The infrared-to-radio SED is decomposed into dust, free-free, and synchrotron components using the hierarchical Bayesian code HerBIE. Dust is modelled via a modified blackbody (MBB) with variable millimetre spectral index beta and the THEMIS dust model with fixed beta. We perform spatially-resolved analysis at scales ~1.75 kpc (~25''), covering the centre, spiral arms, and inter-arm regions. MBB fits reveal beta variations from ~1.6-1.7 in diffuse regions to ~2.3-2.5 in dense star-forming areas, likely due to grain coagulation and changes in silicate-to-carbonaceous ratios. Dust masses from variable beta are up to ~4x higher than fixed-beta models, which systematically bias dust-to-stellar and dust-to-gas ratios. The small grain fraction rises from ~10% in the centre to ~15% in the diffuse disc, anti-correlated with the interstellar radiation field; gas-phase metallicity plays a minor role within 8 kpc. Synchrotron spectral index ranges from ~0.6-0.7 in star-forming regions to ~1.2 in the diffuse medium, consistent with cosmic-ray electron ageing."}

The real part of the potential controls the cosmological background and realizes a plateau-type inflation compatible with $α$-attractor $\\mathrm{T}$-models, while the imaginary part acts as an effective non-Hermitian deformation encoding dissipative effects. Working in the Jordan frame and imposing ghost-free conditions on the effective Planck mass, we derive the background equations and define a complex equation-of-state parameter whose real part governs the expansion and whose imaginary part quantifies departures from conservative dynamics. Numerical integration shows that the duration of inflation is primarily controlled by the nonminimal coupling $ζ$, whereas the complex asymmetry parameter $Δ\\varepsilon$ has a negligible impact on the real background: the real energy density and pressure vary by less than $10^{-5}$ as $Δ\\varepsilon$ is scanned over its allowed range. Mapping the two-field dynamics to an effective single-field description in the Einstein frame, we obtain a spectral index $n_s\\simeq 0.968-0.971$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r<10^{-3}$, fully consistent with Planck 2018 bounds.

Working within a local Rindler-wedge framework, we formulate the Clausius relation as the stationarity condition of a Massieu functional at fixed Unruh temperature, which identifies the entropy slope as the parameter controlling the effective gravitational coupling. For area-type entropies with constant slope, the construction reproduces Einstein's equations with $G_{eff} = 1/(4s_0)$, while curvature-dependent entropy densities supplemented by an internal entropy-production term yield the field equations of $f(R)$ gravity.\n  Motivated by group-entropic considerations and long-range correlations, we model the entropy of horizon cross sections by a power law $S(A) = η(A/4G)^δ$ and analyze its local and global implications. To fix the otherwise arbitrary coarse-graining scale entering the entropy slope, we introduce a Topological Calibration Principle that ties the reference area to intrinsic geometric data through the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. For compact two-dimensional sections, this selects a canonical calibration area and leads to a topology-dependent effective coupling $G_{eff}(χ) \\propto |χ|^{1-δ}$ where $χ$ represents the Euler characteristic. Consistency across scales and topologies yields logarithmic bounds on $|1-δ|$, while the associated scale dependence induces a characteristic modulation of the gravitational coupling in cosmology. The framework thus provides a controlled route to confront non-extensive horizon thermodynamics with both theoretical consistency requirements and observational constraints."}

In the event that at least one of these SMBHs is actively accreting, the system can appear phenomenologically as an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with a broad line region (BLR) kinematically offset from the host galaxy rest frame. Such velocity offsets have been interpreted as signatures of binary SMBHs, recoiling SMBHs, or BLR gas dynamics within a single-SMBH system. We present deep Chandra X-ray observations of five nearby (0.1 < z < 0.2) Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars whose broad emission lines are Doppler-shifted relative to their host galaxies' systemic velocities, along with archival Chandra observations of 11 additional sources from the same sample. Using our Chandra data, we constrain SMBH masses with multiple independent techniques. We find systematic, method-dependent differences among black hole mass estimates, with masses inferred from the fundamental plane of black hole activity generally lower and single-epoch virial masses typically higher than those obtained using other methods. We also compare the X-ray photon indices and optical-to-X-ray spectral indices of our quasars to the broader quasar population. While we find no strong differences in optical-to-X-ray spectral indices, we do find systematically harder X-ray photon indices than typically observed in comparable quasars. These results constrain competing physical models but do not provide conclusive evidence for or against a binary SMBH origin of the velocity-offset BLRs."}

Despite numerous observational efforts over the past decade, a statistically robust sample of \"satellite planes\" across the diversity of host galaxy environments is lacking. To guide future observing strategies, we construct a controlled suite of mock observations of on-sky positions and line-of-sight (LOS) velocities of isolated L* host galaxies and their satellite systems, based on samples drawn from the Illustris TNG100-1 cosmological simulation to build a statistical sample. In these mock systems, satellite planes are defined by three key parameters: the number of satellites ($N_{\\mathrm{sat}}$), the fraction residing in a thin co-rotating plane ($f_{p}$), and the orientation angle relative to the observer ($θ_{\\mathrm{rot}}$). We evaluate the sensitivity of three observational metrics, $N_{\\mathrm{cor}}$ (number of co-rotating satellites), $b/a$ (projected flattening of the satellite distribution), and $v_\\mathrm{los}$ (mean absolute LOS velocity), to the presence of such planes. Our results show that detection rates are strongly dependent on $θ_{\\mathrm{rot}}$ and $N_{\\mathrm{sat}}$. Satellite planes that are viewed nearly edge-on or face-on, are the most readily detected. In contrast, intermediate orientations and systems with fewer satellites yield low detection success rates. Generally, only satellite planes with $N_{\\mathrm{sat}}>20$ have high chances of being detected. These findings provide a practical framework for prioritising observational targets and designing future surveys aimed at detecting and characterising satellite planes."}

The stellar mass follows a multi-Gaussian expansion light model with a free global mass-to-light ratio and an allowed radial $M/L$ gradient, while the dark matter is described by an elliptical generalised NFW halo. The double-source-plane geometry provides additional leverage against the mass-sheet transformation and helps constrain the radial mass profile.

Here we put forward a new physical model to explain how a large number of small dusty gas clumps form and they collectively appear as a geometrically thick dynamic dusty torus. The circumnuclear hot gas flows towards the central black hole (BH) and forms a rotating disk on sub-pc scales. A fraction of inflowing hot gas condenses to form small cold clumps due to thermal instabilities, when the accretion rate is sufficiently high. These cold dusty gas clumps are irradiated by the central accretion disk and re-radiate as dust emission mostly in the infrared. We propose that the dusty torus in AGN consists of such cold clumps vertically supported by the radiation force against gravity. For clumps with suitable column density, the vertical component of the BH gravity is in quasi-static equilibrium with the infrared radiation force together with the vertical component of the disk radiation force. Our model is robust in the sense that for any reasonable range of parameters concerning clump vertical dynamical equilibrium a torus exists. We further show that the hot gas in the rotating flow condenses to cold clumps only if its accretion rate is higher than about one percent of the Eddington rate. The radiation force is unable to lift the cold gas clumps up away from the mid-plane when the luminosity of the disk surrounding the BH is lower than 0.1 percent of the Eddington luminosity. These two features of our model may provide a physical explanation for the lack of evidence of dusty tori in low-luminosity AGNs."}

This framework allows for a sizable tensor-to-scalar ratio r > 0.01 consistent with sub-Planckian inflaton excursions, providing a purely quantum mechanical evasion of the Lyth bound. The resulting mixed state leaves a distinctive \"quantum birthmark\" in the form of oscillatory features in the power spectrum and a characteristic violation of the single-field consistency relation, manifesting as a scale-dependent enhancement of the squeezed-limit bispectrum.

Models often assume that Pop III stellar masses in different minihaloes are stochastic realisations of a single universal initial mass function (IMF). We use 138 cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamics simulations to test this assumption and to map the first-star IMF across redshift, halo mass, and baryon-dark matter streaming velocity (SV). We construct a dense-cloud merger tree and assign first-star masses by mapping the radial gas accretion-rate profile to stellar mass, yielding per-halo stellar mass functions without imposing any a priori IMF. The high-mass tail and multiplicity increase systematically with redshift, halo mass, and SV. Low-mass, low-SV haloes form only one or a few first stars, whereas massive, high-SV haloes host rich first star clusters and commonly produce very massive ($\\gtrsim10^3$-$10^4\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$) first stars. Even in a fixed environment, halo-to-halo scatter remains substantial. Nevertheless, group-averaged IMFs converge to well-defined forms, ruling out a single universal IMF at the halo level across the range of environments probed here. Mapping our seeds onto the redshift-mass plane, we show that high-SV and massive haloes preferentially populate the heavy-seed regime relevant to luminous high-redshift sources. At the same time, low-SV environments are consistent with single/few-event enrichment signatures in metal-poor stars.

A particularly striking feature of these reconstructions is an apparent transition from an early-time phantom-like regime to a late-time quintessence-like behavior. For positive-definite DE densities, this transition is often phrased as a crossing of the phantom divide line (PDL) at $w(a)=-1$. Allowing the DE density to become negative, however, renders the PDL (in the sense of $w(a)=-1$) non-diagnostic as a global separator: the physically meaningful criterion is instead the null energy condition boundary (NECB), $ρ_{\\rm DE}+p_{\\rm DE}=0$. We therefore test whether the data-driven preference for NECB-crossing in CPL reconstructions persists once alternative realizations of phantom behavior are admitted, specifically through sign-switching DE densities. To this end, we introduce and constrain two controlled phenomenological extensions of the CPL framework featuring a negative DE phase in the past. In the CPL$\\to-Λ$ model, the switching epoch is tied to the CPL-inferred NECB-crossing scale factor, yielding an early-time negative cosmological-constant phase, while the post-switch evolution follows the CPL branch. In the sCPL model, the CPL equation of state is maintained at all times, while the sign switch in the energy density occurs at an independent transition redshift. We find that late-time BAO and SNeIa data drive the negative-density phase beyond their effective redshift coverage, and that this requirement is the primary driver of the inferred parameter behavior. While both models are statistically disfavored relative to the baseline CPL, admitting a negative DE phase generally reduces the significance of deviations from a cosmological constant."}

These results demonstrate the importance of combining UV, optical, IR, and X-ray observations to probe both obscured and unobscured star formation, the metal enrichment, and the outflow-driven evolution of starburst galaxies."}

The stellar mass follows a multi-Gaussian expansion light model with a free global mass-to-light ratio and an allowed radial $M/L$ gradient, while the dark matter is described by an elliptical generalised NFW halo. The double-source-plane geometry provides additional leverage against the mass-sheet transformation and helps constrain the radial mass profile. Despite allowing both a radial stellar $M/L$ gradient and a generalised NFW halo, the data prefer the canonical picture: an approximately constant stellar mass-to-light ratio with a Salpeter-like IMF normalisation, and a dark matter halo consistent with NFW. We infer $M_{\\star} = 4.4^{+0.25}_{-0.39}\\times 10^{11}\\,M_{\\odot}$ and an inner halo slope $γ_{\\rm in}^{\\rm halo} = 1.04^{+0.10}_{-0.14}$.

While LRDs are efficient environments for BH growth, many show no X-ray evidence of strong AGN emission. We utilize a subsample of X-ray non-detected LRDs to test the compatibility of collision-based BH formation scenarios and constrain physical parameters like metallicity and column density.Our results indicate LRDs are ideal birthplaces for massive BHs, particularly given a mass-radius relation $R_{gal} \\propto M_{gal}^{0.6}$. Collision-based models suggest seed masses larger than those in the local Universe, consistent with high-redshift BH mass-radius relations. We modeled BH seed formation and X-ray emission (0.3-7 keV) against observed upper limits. We find that mass-radius exponents $> 0.55$ favor the collision-based scenario; however, consistency with stacked X-ray analysis requires specific accretion and obscuration parameters. Constant or increasing SFR scenarios with high Eddington ratios are feasible but necessitate larger column densities or higher metal enrichment. Alternatively, moderate sub-Eddington accretion reconciles massive seeds with observed masses and X-ray weakness. We conclude that even if LRDs began as starbursts, they should eventually evolve into AGNs."}

In the first paper of this series we presented HINORA - a code to locate (ring-like) structures in 3D point sets - and used it to identify the CoG in the most complete observations of the Local Volume. Here, in Part II, we apply the same method to cosmological simulations to quantify the possible existence of such objects in the LCDM model of structure formation. We analyze DM-only simulations with random and constrained initial conditions, selecting regions that reproduce the properties of the Local Group and Volume, respectively. In order to use the same selection criteria as previsouly done for observations, we relate K-band luminosities to halo masses through semi-empirical relations. After confirming that the selected regions from the simulations match the observed mass function and density of the Local Universe, we use HINORA to search for ring-like structures in them. We find that the existence of CoGs in LCDM simulations is a rather unusual phenomenon. The observed CoG represents an anomaly of more than 2.7 sigma from what is expected in the distribution of massive galaxies in LCDM. These results hint that the CoG could either be a rare chance configuration or the imprint of physical processes at intermediate scales that standard DM-only simulations fail to capture."}

We present magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of strongly magnetized (plasma-$β$ << 1) HII region evolution that investigate and describe the formation of these ionized gas filaments. HII region evolution has been simulated in a 30 pc$^3$ box, in distinct models with pre-placed overdensities in the ambient medium and overdensities that have been generated with driven turbulence. We find that when these overdensities are seeded in the ambient medium before the birth of the ionizing source, the photoionized plasma stripped off of these dense blobs is funneled into long filaments along the magnetic field lines. The length and emission measure of these ionized gas filaments are similar to the filaments observed in the Central Molecular Zone. Given that these filaments are effectively magnetically-confined flows of photoionized gas, their density and curvature are influenced by the density of the blob and the geometry of the configuration."}

In this study, we investigated the surface reactions of solid CS$_2$ with hydrogen (H) atoms on amorphous solid water (ASW) using laboratory experiments supported by computational calculations. Our results show that CS$_2$ reacts with H atoms through quantum tunneling in the initial step, followed by successive H addition reactions, with or without activation barriers, on icy surfaces. These processes lead to the formation of several sulfur-bearing species, including hydrogen sulfide (H$_2$S), methyl mercaptan (CH$_3$SH), and small amounts of dithioformic acid (HC(S)SH) and methanedithiol (CH$_2$(SH)$_2$). The observed reactivity of CS$_2$ with H atoms provides a plausible explanation for the non-detection of CS$_2$ in interstellar ices. Furthermore, the efficient hydrogenation of the complex molecules derived from CS$_2$, namely HC(S)SH and CH$_2$(SH)$_2$, suggests that these species could be easily undergone with H atoms to produce other S-bearing species under ISM conditions."}

Here we show that such scattering reaches a steady-state distribution function of stellar eccentricity, after which eccentricity increases and decreases occur at equal rates. The implication is that clump/cloud scattering recircularizes eccentric stellar orbits, keeping the stellar velocity dispersion in a limited range. This re-circularization regulates disk heating and maintains kinematic coherence, contributing to the longevity of disk structures. The eccentricity distribution function and the presence of recircularizing cloud-star interactions are independent of cloud mass but the timescale to reach equilibrium decreases with increasing mass. The calculations are made in the simplest possible disk system to highlight the effects of scattering without contamination from spiral waves, star formation, and other processes. The calculations also reveal a bifurcation in the disk evolutions whereby in a minority of cases temporary asymmetries in the clump spatial distribution drive the disks to an end state of increased velocity dispersion and orbital eccentricity corresponding to early type disks. Overall the models emphasize an important physical process that can make and maintain an exponential stellar disk in all galaxies with a cloudy interstellar medium."}

Here, we utilize archival HST/ACS and JWST/NIRCam observations of the nearby dwarf star-forming galaxy WLM to study RR Lyrae in JWST filters. We independently identify RR Lyrae in HST and JWST imaging in order to evaluate JWST's efficacy at characterizing RR Lyrae in the near-IR. We use an MCMC template-fitting technique to obtain periods, amplitudes, and mean magnitudes from the RR Lyrae time-series data. The spatially overlapping HST and JWST observations allow us to directly compare the same sources observed with the instruments, and calibrate the NIRCam F090W and F150W RR Lyrae period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ) relation to the Gaia-consistent HST PWZ. We additionally assess the epoch-to-epoch consistency of NIRCam photometry, and find evidence of burn-in. We conclude that the zero-point offset is negligible compared to the uncertainties from the template fitting. We conduct an MCMC fit of the PWZ with both HST and JWST data. Our results are three-fold. First, we find that we can reliably identify RR Lyrae in NIRCam data, but light-curve template fitting proves difficult on short-baseline observations. Second, the HST PWZ fit yields a distance modulus to WLM of $μ= 24.85\\pm0.05$ ($0.93\\pm0.02$ Mpc). This is closer than previous measurements, primarily attributed to consistency with the Gaia scale. Lastly, although the JWST PWZ fit has large uncertainties and a poorly-constrained slope, it represents a first-of-its-kind PWZ calibration in NIRCam filters."}

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "Context: We present the first Cosmological Parameter inferences from eROSITA X-ray observations of galaxy clusters using a Machine Learning algorithm. Methods: We train a Random Forest using mock catalogs of clusters from Magneticum multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations. We apply the trained ML algorithm to observed X-ray features (gas luminosity, mass, and temperature) at different redshifts from the eROSITA eFEDS and eRASS1 catalogs. Results: We obtain cosmological constraints with precision comparable to those from standard analyses, such as weak lensing and cluster abundances. We infer $Ω_{\\rm m}=0.30^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, $σ_8=0.81\\pm0.01$, and $h_0=0.710\\pm0.004$. The recovered parameters show no tension in the $Ω_{\\rm m}-σ_8$ space, but a significant deviation of $h_0$ from the Planck estimates. These inferences remain rather stable against variations of the input observable set and parameter space coverage. These results indicate that correlations among intracluster properties contain cosmological information beyond that encoded in the cluster abundance alone, which can be captured by machine learning trained on multi-cosmology simulations. Conclusions: ML algorithms trained on multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations can effectively infer cosmological parameters directly from galaxy cluster data. This is a change of paradigm in the context of cosmological parameter inferences. This approach complements traditional cluster-count analyses and is particularly suited to large upcoming surveys, where systematic uncertainties in mass calibration may otherwise dominate the error budget. It also highlights the potential of large-scale X-ray surveys to deliver independent tests of the standard cosmological model."}

This framework is developed as a modular layer that builds on semi-analytical models. In particular we use as bases the Galaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) and L-Galaxies semi-analytical models, coupled to merger trees from the Millennium Simulation suite. We validate our framework against local Universe observations, demonstrating consistency with velocity functions, and generalised Tully-Fisher relations. Predictions based on GAEA and L-Galaxies exhibit mutual consistency despite the distinct underlying physical prescriptions. We construct mock galaxy catalogues that incorporate forward-modelled selection functions, inclination effects, and redshift broadening, reproducing the statistical distributions of HI-selected galaxies in the ALFALFA survey. Finally, we present redshift distribution forecasts for future SKA Observatory HI galaxy surveys. This framework offers a flexible tool for interpreting upcoming large-scale radio surveys and studying HI line observables as cosmological probes."}
