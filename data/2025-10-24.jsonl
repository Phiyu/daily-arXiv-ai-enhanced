The majority of previous work has utilised N-body\nsimulations with a background potential to model the effects of gas removal.\nHere, we adopt a different approach where we take the end point of hydrodynamic\nsimulations of star formation in which stars form with and without feedback\nfrom massive stars and then evolve the stars as N-body simulations. We also\nscale the velocities of the stars to various virial ratios, to mimic slower or\nfaster removal of gas, and evolve these as additional N-body simulations. We\nfind that the simulations where the stars inherit the velocities of the sink\nparticles from the hydrodynamic simulations predominantly evolve more like a\nsimulation in virial equilibrium, rather than the supervirial behaviour we\nwould expect after gas removal. We see no significant differences in the\ndynamical evolution between the simulations where the stars inherit velocities\ndirectly from the hydrodynamical simulations and the simulations with\n(sub)virial velocities. This strongly suggests that gas removal by feedback\nprocesses does not lead to rapid expansion of star-forming regions, beyond the\nexpansion caused by dynamical relaxation in star-forming regions."}

Here, we adapt this\nformalism to incorporate template deprojection as a means of mitigating\nsystematic biases in the measured angular power spectra. We also introduce and\nvalidate an alternative method of mitigating the so-called `deprojection bias',\ncaused by the loss of modes after deprojection, employing the use of simple\nsimulations to compute a transfer function.

Additionally, we develop exact expressions\nfor the bias introduced by deprojection in the shot-noise component, which\nfurther improves the accuracy of this approach. We test our formalism on\nsimulated datasets, demonstrating its applicability both to discretely sampled\nfields, and to the special case of galaxy clustering, with the survey selection\nfunction defined in terms of a random catalogue or as a continuous sky map.\nAfter computing and removing the bias in the shot noise and using a transfer\nfunction to correct for the remaining mode loss, our formalism is able to\nproduce unbiased measurements of the angular power spectrum in all scenarios\ntested here.

In\nprevious works, distance measurement compilations, e.g. the CosmicFlows-3\ncatalogue, were used for this purpose, as it comprises a large number ($\\sim\n10^4$) of sources of different types. Due to the increasing amount of precise\nluminosity distance measurements of Type Ia Supenovae (SNe) in the last few\nyears, in this work we investigate whether we can confirm the uniformity of the\nHubble flow with low-$z$ SN distances only. By means of the Pantheon+ and SH0ES\ncompilation, we find that the results align well with previous works based on\nthe CF3 catalogue, and are in good agreement with the expected Hubble variance\nin the standard model across cosmic scales of $20-150$ Mpc.

In\nthis paper, we compute and discuss the gravitational waves emitted by\ninspiraling and merging white dwarf binaries, and assess their detectability\nwith proposed space-based atom-interferometer detectors such as MAGIS Space and\nAEDGE. Gravitational waves from massive white dwarf binaries can be observed\nfor many years before merger, offering a unique early warning of their final\nexplosion.

With simple models, we show that the effect of an [O III]\nflux-limited sample on the observed shape of the MZR is strongly dependent on\nthe FMR. If the FMR is similar to the one in the local Universe, the intrinsic\nhigh-redshift MZR should be even flatter than observed. In turn, a 3D relation\nwhere SFR correlates positively with metallicity at fixed mass would imply an\nintrinsically steeper MZR. Our measurements indicate that metallicity\nvariations at fixed mass show little dependence on the SFR, suggesting a flat\nintrinsic MZR. This could indicate that the low-mass galaxies at these\nredshifts are out of equilibrium and that metal enrichment occurs rapidly in\nlow-mass galaxies. However, being limited by our stacking analysis, we are yet\nto probe the scatter in the MZR and its dependence on SFR. Large carefully\nselected samples of galaxies with robust metallicity measurements can put tight\nconstraints on the high-redshift FMR and, help to understand the interplay\nbetween gas flows, star formation and feedback in early galaxies."}

It is based on the postulations\nthat quantum states, which violate the momentum and Hamiltonian constraints,\nrepresent instances of time, and stochastic fluctuations of the lapse and shift\ngenerate the time evolution under which an initial state gradually collapses\ntoward a diffeomorphism-invariant state. Under the wavefunction collapse, the\nscale factor monotonically increases, thus acting as a clock. The scalar,\nvector, and tensor gravitons arise as physical excitations, and the arrow of\ntime for their evolution is set by the initial state. In the long-time limit,\nthe tensor gravitons exhibit emergent unitary dynamics. However, the extra\nmodes are strongly damped due to the non-unitary dynamics that suppress the\nconstraint-violating excitations. The vector mode is uniformly suppressed over\nall length scales, but the decay rate of the scalar is proportional to its wave\nvector. This makes the latter a viable candidate for dark matter; excitations\nwith large wavelengths survive over long periods, contributing to long-range\ninteractions, while the fast decay of short-wavelength modes renders them\nundetectable without sufficient temporal resolution.

Our method consists in obtaining a generic SED for a large sample of\nSeyfert 1 (Sy1; part 1), then applying this SED to Seyfert 2 (Sy2; Part~II),\nexpecting that the only difference will be the line-of-sight (LOS) angle, $i$,\nrelative to the polar axis of the torus of gas and dust obscuring the broad\nline regions (BLRs). Our sample is composed of 3,896 Type 1, Sy1 at low\nredshifts, $ z<0.4$, separated into four spectral subgroups depending on the\npresence or absence in their spectra of narrow emission lines, Sy1N/Sy1B, and\nAGN wind, Sy1Bw and Sy1Nw. The generic SED produced by X-CIGALE applies to 90\\%\nof the Sy1 in our sample. It includes a clumpy torus with an AGN engine seen\nface-on ($i \\sim 10^\\circ \\pm 5^\\circ$). Our analysis not only supports the\nexistence of a torus in Sy1, in good agreement with UPAGN, but also reveals new\nfacts about the accretion of matter and AGN wind: 1- a sudden accretion of\nmatter from the BLR to the accretion disk triggered the wind, 2- matter from\nthe wind replenishes the torus, consistent with a gradual formation of this\nstructure by recurrent AGN winds, and 3- Sy1Bw and Sy1Nw eventually evolve as\nAGN without wind, leaving behind a torus as evidence of a higher AGN activity\nin their past."}

While white dwarfs are abundant in the universe and relatively well\nunderstood, their gravitational wave signals have not yet been directly\nobserved. In order to detect gravitational waves from merging white dwarf\nbinaries, a detector in the mid-band between LVK and LISA appears necessary. In\nthis paper, we compute and discuss the gravitational waves emitted by\ninspiraling and merging white dwarf binaries, and assess their detectability\nwith proposed space-based atom-interferometer detectors such as MAGIS Space and\nAEDGE. Gravitational waves from massive white dwarf binaries can be observed\nfor many years before merger, offering a unique early warning of their final\nexplosion. Our projections suggest that MAGIS Space could detect signals from\nType Ia supernova progenitors at least once every four years, while AEDGE could\nobserve at least a few hundred such events annually. The prolonged\ngravitational wave emission captured by atom-interferometers provides precise\nsky localisation and can allow observation of the final explosion with\nelectromagnetic telescopes.

We find that\none can reasonably construct a wave packet that covers outside, but the wave\nfunction must be annihilated near the event horizon. This observation strongly\nsuggests that we cannot choose a coherent state for a spacelike hypersurface\nthat crosses the event horizon. To explain the unitary time evolution, we must\nkeep the slices as coherent states; hence, they must always be outside the\nevent horizon.

Foo"], "title": "Strong Lensing Model and Dust Extinction Maps of the Host Galaxy of Type Ia Supernova H0pe", "comment": "13 pages, submitted to A&A", "summary": "Strong gravitational lensing by massive galaxy clusters offers particularly\nrare opportunities to observe multiple images of distant ($z\\gtrsim2$) Type Ia\nsupernovae (SNe) and resolve the properties of their host galaxies. A recent\noutstanding example is the Type Ia SN \"H0pe\" ($z=1.78$), discovered in James\nWebb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam images when it was still triply imaged by\nthe galaxy cluster PLCK G165.7+67.0 (G165, $z=0.35$). In this work we build a\nnew strong lensing model of G165, first by using only the position of multiple\nimages of background galaxies. We then increase significantly the number of\nconstraints around the position of SN H0pe by modeling the extended surface\nbrightness of the SN host galaxy. The average uncertainty on mass model\nparameters is reduced by more than an order of magnitude. We also study the\nspatial distribution of dust in the arc to estimate the dust extinction at the\nposition of SN H0pe. We find good statistical agreement of the extinction\nestimate at $\\lesssim1\\sigma$ with three fully independent methods based on\nspectral energy distribution fitting. Moreover, our extended-image lens model\nof G165 allows us to map the dust distribution of the host galaxy from the\nimage plane to the source plane. Supernova H0pe exploded in a region with a\nrelatively high extinction of $A_V \\approx 0.9\\ {\\rm mag}$ at around $\\sim 1\\\n{\\rm kpc}$ from its host center. This work shows that extended image modeling\nin lensing clusters simultaneously reduces the uncertainty on lens model\nparameters and enables spatially resolved analyses of lensed transients host\ngalaxies. Such modeling advances are expected to play an important role in\nfuture cosmological analyses using strongly lensed SNe."}
