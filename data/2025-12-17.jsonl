For four representative modified entropies, namely Barrow, Rényi, Kaniadakis, and logarithmic, we derive the corresponding effective metrics and analyze their thermodynamic and topological classification using the off-shell free energy and winding numbers. We show that Barrow and Rényi entropies yield a single unstable sector with global charge $W=-1$, while logarithmic and Kaniadakis corrections produce canceling defects with $W=0$, revealing topological structures absent in the Schwarzschild case. Using the modified metrics, we further calculate the photon-sphere radius and shadow size, showing that each modified entropy relation induces characteristic optical shifts. Thus, by comparing with Event Horizon Telescope observations of Sgr A$^\\ast$, we extract new bounds on all entropy-deformation parameters. Our results demonstrate that thermodynamic topology, together with photon-sphere phenomenology, offers a viable way to test generalized entropy frameworks and probe departures from the Bekenstein-Hawking area law."}

While it is well-motivated theoretically, There has always been controversy over its actual existence. The AdS-dS transition is corresponding to a sign switching $Λ$. We have proposed an ansatz for a negative time-varying cosmological constant $Λ(H)$ as a function of Hubble parameter $H$, and used it in constructing a periodic model with no future singularity in a scale-invariance gravity. With the proposed Ansatz for negative $Λ$, The model leads to a physically acceptable cosmic description, while we get unphysical parameters with the positive and zero values of $Λ$. The model reveals a Quintom behavior with a sign flipping of cosmic pressure during each period. The non-conventional mechanism of negative $Λ$ that are expected to address the late-time acceleration has been revisited."}

In this work, we generalize the embedding procedure to slices with arbitrary polar angles $θ\\neq π/2$, thereby extending the visualization and analysis of spacetimes beyond the reach of traditional methods.\n  The formalism is applied to Schwarzschild-like wormholes and to a generalized Minkowski spacetime with angular deficit or excess, which are particularly relevant since their equatorial slices cannot be consistently embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.

We propose vanishing transverse pressure on the surface for, namely graviton condensate type 1 and vanishing radial pressure on the surface for type 2. The condition for the radial pressure of type 1 requires the existence of a thin shell that will balance the pressure discontinuity while for type 2, the discontinuity on transverse pressure does not require the additional thin shell. It is found that the Buchdahl inequality of the resulting stellar configurations depends on the parameter related to the graviton condensate, such that we can find the ultra-compact regime of the stellar models. Moreover, the echo time and echo frequency within the ultra-compact regime are computed. At the same compactness, it is found that the presence of the graviton condensate will delay the gravitational echoes for type 2 and will expedite the gravitational echoes for type 1 compared to constant density star, $τ_{echo2}>τ_{CDS}>τ_{echo1}$. Furthermore, the gravitational perturbation of a massless scalar wave is also investigated to support these results.

HOLCon includes a module to optimise the lightcone's orientation within the simulation box, minimising repeated structures when the survey volume exceeds a single box -- a common challenge in modern surveys. A linear interpolation scheme tracks the evolution of halo properties across snapshots. Applied to the publicly available Uchuu simulation, we construct a lightcone of 50 ${\\rm deg}^2$ and extending up to $z = 10$, providing representative coverage of deep fields of Stage IV surveys. We validate the lightcone for cosmological applications by comparing the dark matter halo clustering in the lightcone with those from the original simulation snapshots. Subsequently, we make the galaxy-halo connection on the lightcone with a redshift extended version of the SciPIC algorithm producing a comprehensive set of descriptive galaxy attributes. HOLCon leverages Dask, a scalable parallel computing pythonic framework for fast construction of dark matter halo lightcones enabling rapid creation of multiple statistical realizations essential for robust cosmological inference.

We investigate the dust, gas, and stellar properties of the gravitationally lensed LAE HCM 6A at $z=6.5676$ to characterize its multiphase ISM and the physical conditions regulating Ly$α$ escape. We combine JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopy, HST+JWST/NIRCam imaging, and JWST/NIRSpec slit spectra from the CANUCS program. Using a customized BAGPIPES SED-fitting framework with a flexible attenuation law, we derive stellar, nebular, and dust properties on integrated ($\\sim$kpc), slit-level ($\\sim$0.1 kpc), and pixel-level ($\\sim$25 pc) scales, enabled by strong lensing ($μ\\approx 8.3$-$9.1$).

Ly$α$ emission arises primarily from S3, where a dust-cleared central clump enables efficient Ly$α$ escape. We find Calzetti-like attenuation curves with a UV bump that strengthens with stellar age and decreasing $A_V$.

Analytical studies and high-resolution simulations have recently predicted the formation of 'prompt cusps' - steep power-law density profiles that emerge rapidly from the monolithic collapse of primordial peaks. Yet, by $z=0$ most haloes are well described by Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profiles, raising the question of how these early cusps are transformed in a cosmological setting. We address this problem using 64 zoom-in $N$-body simulations of eight haloes, each resimulated with eight different free-streaming wavenumbers to control the abundance of small-scale structure while keeping the large-scale environment fixed. To mitigate numerical discreteness effects, we classify artificial fragments and genuine subhaloes with a physically motivated procedure based on matching subhaloes to their progenitor peaks. At the population level, we demonstrate that haloes initially form prompt cusps, and their profiles subsequently transition towards the NFW form. Our study reveals three distinct pathways by which prompt cusps evolve: major mergers, accretion of artificial fragments, and interactions with large-scale filaments, each having a distinct impact on the inner density profile. In particular, we show that the original power-law cusp remains visible in the profile of particles associated with the primordial peak even when the total halo profile is already NFW-like. This work highlights the imprint of early collapse on present-day halo structure and provides new insights into the origin of the universality of the NFW profile."}

The addition of DESI radial velocities enables secure membership determination in 16 systems, spanning ultra-faint, classical, and irregular dwarf galaxies. Our results confirm that Gaia-based selection algorithms are effective in minimising foreground contamination. With DR1, we find the largest number of member stars for Draco and Sextans. While Draco is discussed in detail in other works, we focus on Sextans and, for the first time with DESI, trace its stellar kinematics to large radii (up to $\\sim$10~half-light radii). Our derived systemic velocity and velocity dispersion are consistent with previous works. We find that the more metal-poor population exhibits a higher velocity dispersion and extends to larger radii, whereas the more metal-rich population is kinematically colder and centrally concentrated. The metallicity gradient is steeper in the inner regions of Sextans ($\\sim -9\\times 10^{-3}$~dex~arcmin$^{-1}$ or $\\sim-0.29$~dex~kpc$^{-1}$), while almost no gradient in the outskirts, hinting for an ex-situ halo or for an ``outside-in'' star formation.

From the hydrodynamic and matched dark-matter-only runs, we measure a comprehensive list of halo properties describing density structure, angular momentum, shape, assembly history, and environment. Using the morphological decomposition developed in Paper I, we quantify the sizes, scale heights, and mass fractions of the disk components for galaxies at $0 \\le z \\le 4$. Random Forest (RF) regression shows halo properties alone predict disk size and thickness with high accuracy, while Symbolic Regression (SR) provides compact empirical relations with slightly lower accuracy. Disk height is consistently easier to predict than disk size, and lower-mass halos yield higher accuracy than massive halos. Predictions based on halo properties measured in the full-physics hydro simulations outperform those based on the matched dark-matter-only halos, reflecting the imprint of baryonic restructuring on the inner halo. SHAP analysis reveals that the most informative halo parameters include concentration, Einasto shape, global and inner spin, and recent mass accretion, though their importance varies across disk properties. We show that correlations between disk size and the density-profile shape arise primarily from disk-induced modification of the inner halo, rather than a primordial connection. Finally, we point out that disks become more extended with respect to their host halos at higher redshift in low-mass halos, while massive high-redshift halos show the opposite trend. We provide SR-based prescriptions that accurately map halo properties to disk structures, offering practical tools for galaxy-halo modeling."}

They are theoretically predicted to form in several early-Universe pathways, including the remnants of massive Population III stars, the runaway collapse of dense stellar clusters, and the direct collapse of metal-poor gas. Establishing whether IMBHs are present in dwarf galaxy satellites of the Milky Way (MW), and with what occupation fraction - i.e. the fraction of galaxies with a certain stellar mass that host a central BH - provides one of the most incisive tests of BH seed formation models. Despite their importance, present dynamical constraints on IMBHs remain weak. Dynamical IMBH masses or upper limits are available for very few such systems, with secure detections in less than ten cases.

The evolution is commonly divided into three stages: the adiabatic inspiral, the transition, and the plunge. To date, constructions of inspiral-transition-plunge waveforms have largely focused on Schwarzschild or Kerr background spacetimes. In this paper, we extend these efforts to spacetimes beyond Kerr by constructing such waveforms in a Kerr-Newman background. For simplicity, we allow the primary black hole to carry spin and charge while keeping the secondary object neutral and non-spinning. We work in the small charge-to-mass ratio regime and adopt the Dudley-Finley approximation, in which the gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations decouple. In particular, the gravitational sector satisfies a Teukolsky-like equation, enabling only minimal modifications relative to the Kerr case when constructing the waveform. Having the inspiral-transtion-plunge waveforms in hand, we studied observational prospects for constraining the charge of the central black hole. We find that, for intermediate-mass-ratio mergers observed with the Einstein Telescope, explicitly modeling the post-inspiral dynamics significantly tightens charge-to-mass ratio constraints. In particular, the bounds on the charge-to-mass ratio can reach $O(10^{-3})$ in the region of primary masses and spins where the post-inspiral signal dominates, yielding charge bounds that can be orders of magnitude tighter than those obtained from the inspiral alone or from the current bound with GW150914. These results lay the groundwork for inspiral-transition-plunge waveform modeling in beyond-Kerr spacetimes and for probing non-Kerr signatures in future GW observations."}

Its manifestation as an additional source of matter necessary to explain astrophysical and cosmological observations indicates either a breakdown of General Relativity or that the current Standard Model of Particle Physics is incomplete. In the standard Cold DM (CDM) paradigm, DM consists of collisionless non-relativistic particles with negligible non-gravitational interactions. This simple hypothesis is very successful on large and intermediate scales, but faces challenges on small galactic scales. Local Group (LG) dwarf galaxies can play a fundamental role to elucidate whether these challenges stem from poorly understood fundamental baryonic processes or instead indicate that alternative DM scenarios need to be considered. In particular, a systematic determination of their DM halo properties as a function of stellar mass and star formation histories (SFH) will provide crucial observational benchmarks for models to deal with the trickiest issue that prevents us from advancing in our understanding of DM nature, i.e. the impact of baryonic processes in altering the properties of the inner regions of DM haloes. Such systematic study would require assembling accurate l.o.s. velocities (and metallicities) for several thousands of stars per galaxy, for an heterogeneous sample of target galaxies, spanning order of magnitudes in stellar mass and covering distances from about 100 kpc to more than 1 Mpc.

We further outline the interplay between rotational superradiance and the Hawking effect, proposing to spatially resolve measurements as a roadmap for `dumb hole spectroscopy' and the study of entanglement dynamics in curved spacetimes."}

Within this inclusive perspective the spectral energy density of the gravitons is sharply suppressed in the aHz region even though the high frequency signal can be comparatively much larger both in the kHz and GHz domains. For there are no direct tests on the expansion rate prior to the formation of the light nuclei, a modified postinflationary timeline affects the total number of $e$-folds and additionally suppresses the tensor to scalar ratio by making the relic signals effectively invisible in the aHz range. The expansion rate prior to nucleosynthesis is further bounded by the evolution of the hypercharge field and the large-scale magnetism also constrains the decelerated expansion rate. The magnetogenesis requirements are compatible with a potentially detectable spectral energy density of the relic gravitons between the MHz and the THz while the tensor to scalar ratio remains suppressed in the aHz region. A maximum of the spectral energy density of the gravitons in the audio domain leads instead to a larger magnetic field when the scale of the gravitational collapse of the protogalaxy (of the order of the Mpc) gets comparable with the Hubble radius before equality. Along a converse viewpoint the results obtained here imply that a long decelerated stage expanding faster than radiation does not affect the high frequency range but reduces the effective number of $e$-folds by so enhancing the tensor to scalar ratio, possibly beyond its observational limit."}

The submillimeter ground-state transitions of methylidyne (CH) and water (H2O), both molecules widespread and coeval in the interstellar medium, provide a sensitive test for variations of alpha, the fine structure constant, and mu, the proton-to-electron mass ratio, taking advantage of the unmatched spectral resolution and frequency reliability of radio techniques. We used ALMA simultaneous observations of the two species to constrain any velocity offset between their absorption profiles toward the radio-bright lensed quasars PKS1830-211 (z_abs=0.88582) and B0218+357 (z_abs=0.68466). Our observational setup minimizes instrumental errors and known sources of systematics, such as time variability of the absorption profile and frequency-dependent morphology of the background quasar. The excellent correlation between CH and H2O opacities, the large number of individual narrow velocity components, and the number of independent spectra obtained due to the intrinsic time variability of the absorption profiles ensure that even the chemical segregation bias is minimized. We obtained bulk velocity shifts delta_v = -0.048 pm 0.028 km/s and -0.13 pm 0.14 km/s (1 sigma confidence level) between CH and H2O in the direction of PKS1830-211(NE) and B0218+357(SW), respectively. These values convert into the 3sigma upper limits |Delta_alpha/alpha| < 0.55 ppm and 1.5 ppm, respectively, taking into account the independent upper limits on |Delta_mu/mu| previously obtained for these systems. These constraints on |Delta_alpha/alpha|, at look-back times of about half the present age of the Universe, are two to four times deeper than previous constraints on any other single high-z system."}

However, their origin has been debated for decades. Potential sources include internal processes (e.g., mass loss from evolved stars), external mechanisms (e.g., minor mergers or cooling flows), or a combination of both. Gas-rich minor mergers have long been proposed as an important channel for cold gas fueling in both observations and simulations, but direct evidence of cold gas transportation via gas-rich minor mergers remains elusive, particularly in galaxy groups and clusters where environmental effects are prevalent. In this letter, we present the first unambiguous case of direct cold gas transportation onto a brightest group galaxy (BGG) at $z=0.25$, driven by an ongoing close-separation gas-rich minor merger with a mass ratio of $\\sim1:56$. High-resolution JWST imaging reveals a heavily obscured, low-mass satellite that is barely visible at restframe optical wavelengths. Tidal stripping from this satellite deposits gas and dust onto the BGG, forming prominent $\\sim$10 kpc dust lanes in situ. Cosmological simulations indicate that such interactions preferentially occur in gas-rich satellites undergoing their first infall in highly eccentric orbits. Our results highlight the pivotal role of gas-rich minor mergers in replenishing cold gas reservoirs and shaping the evolution of central ETGs in galaxy groups."}

They admit extra parameters beyond mass, charge, and angular momentum, leading to a richer phenomenology. Characterizing their allowed parameter space is therefore crucial, especially in light of the available data from electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations. The rotating hairy black hole solutions studied here are inspired by the gravitational decoupling method and satisfy the Einstein field equations with a conserved energy-momentum tensor that respects the strong energy conditions (SECs). We explore in detail the horizon structure of such black holes and report for the first time certain unique features, not observed in Kerr BHs. We investigate the sensitivity of the hairy parameters on the fundamental frequencies associated with the motion of matter in the hairy Kerr spacetime, and compare them with the Kerr scenario. The theoretical models aimed to explain the observed high-frequency observations (HFQPOs) in BHs are associated with the fundamental frequencies. Hence, such a study enables us to constrain the parameter space of the hairy Kerr spacetime by comparing the model-dependent HFQPO frequencies with the available observations. By comparing the kinematic models of HFQPOs with the observations of six BH sources, we report the most favored parameter space for each of these BHs. Our analysis also provides a framework to discern the most suitable model for each of these sources. Interestingly, even with the present precision of the data, the Relativistic Precession Model seems to be less suitable compared to the Tidal Disruption Model for the sources GRO J1655-40 and XTE J1859+226.

By performing a full numerical integration of the multifield background and linear perturbations, we identify distinct dynamical regimes controlled by the non-minimal coupling $ξ_h$. For $ξ_h \\sim \\mathcal{O}(0.1)$, the turning rate of the inflationary trajectory induces transient multifield effects that imprint localized features in the scalar power spectrum.

Our analysis emphasizes the complementary potential of these techniques to constrain parameters such as the minimum mass of ionizing sources and the ionization fraction $x_e$.

The previous analysis is then used to develop the null surface formulation (NSF) of general relativity, a radical framework that postulates the structure of light cones rather than the metric itself as the fundamental gravitational variable.

We find that these black holes can produce LRD-like observables when their emission is modeled with a dense gas cloud shrouding the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Between redshifts 5 and 8, we find the number density of LRDs in this simulation to be $\\rm 2.04 \\pm 0.32 \\times 10^{-4} \\space Mpc^{-3}$, which is broadly consistent with current estimates for the total LRD population from JWST. Their emission in the rest-frame visible spectrum is dominated by their AGN, which induces the red color indicative of LRDs via a very strong Balmer break. Additionally, the elevated mass of the black holes reduces the temperature of their accretion discs. This shifts the peak of the AGN emission towards longer wavelengths, and increases their brightness in the rest-frame visible spectrum relative to lower mass black holes accreting at the same rate. These simulated LRDs have very minimal dust attenuation ($\\rm A_V = 0.21 \\pm 0.12$), limiting the amount of dust re-emission that would occur in the infrared, making them very likely to fall below the observed detection limits from observatories like the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). In contrast to the BRAHMA box, the ASTRID simulation produces systematically smaller black holes and predicts LRD number densities that are more than two orders of magnitude lower than current measurements. We therefore conclude that the presence of black holes that are overmassive relative to their host galaxy, and enshrouded in dense gas, is necessary for AGN-dominated LRD models to reproduce both the observed properties and abundances of JWST LRD populations."}

This system exhibits an extreme black-hole-to-stellar mass ratio and unusually low metallicity, posing significant challenges to BH seeding models. Motivated by these discoveries, we perform high-resolution cosmological simulations with a massive primordial black hole (PBH; $M_{\\rm BH}=5\\times10^7\\,M_\\odot$) seed, incorporating for the first time a fully coupled treatment of PBH accretion, BH feedback, and Population~III/II star formation and stellar feedback. Although PBHs accelerate structure formation through the seed effect, the associated strong thermal feedback from the accretion delays the onset of star formation to $z\\lesssim 10$, producing short, bursty episodes throughout the subsequent evolution. PBH-driven outflows expel enriched gas from the nucleus, while sustained inflows from the intergalactic medium continuously replenish pristine material. This feedback-regulated cycle naturally yields low accretion rates ($\\dot{m}_{\\rm BH}/\\dot{m}_{\\rm edd} \\sim 1-10\\%$), subsolar metallicities ($Z/Z_\\odot\\lesssim10^{-2}$) and extreme $M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star$ ratios during both the initial star-forming phase and the subsequent quenching phases, in excellent agreement with JWST observations. Our results demonstrate that massive PBHs offer a viable pathway for forming the most extreme high-redshift systems, providing a physically motivated explanation for the extraordinary properties of Abell 2744-QSO1, as a sub-class of the broader population of JWST-discovered \"little red dots\"."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "The origin of the multiphase gas within the Fermi/eROSITA bubbles is crucial for understanding Galactic Center (GC) feedback. We use HI4PI data to investigate the kinematics and physical properties of high-velocity clouds (HVCs) toward the GC. Our results reveal that the HVCs exhibit a distinct asymmetric distribution, closely associated with the bar-driven tilted dust lanes and the distorted overshooting streams. We propose that powerful nuclear outflows interact with these gas-rich, off-plane structures, striping and entraining cold gas from the outer Galactic regions (R_GC~0.5--1.7 kpc) rather than solely from the region of the central molecular zone (CMZ; R_GC<0.3 kpc). In this scenario, as the Galactic bar drives gas inflows along the dust lanes, nuclear outflows simultaneously break through the CMZ, sweeping up and ablating cold gas from the boundary layer of these pre-existing structures. This process naturally accounts for the observed high turbulence, complex spectral signatures, and anomalous spatial-kinematic gas patterns, as well as multiwavelength asymmetries of the bubbles. The HVCs are accelerated to about 230--340 km/s over a dynamical time of ~3--6 Myr. When the multiphase, inhomogeneous composition of the gas is included, the estimated gas outflow rate reaches ~1 Msun/yr. This value is comparable to the bar-driven inflow rate, indicating a tightly coupled gas cycle in the inner Galaxy. Our research highlights the critical role of bar-driven gas dynamics and nuclear feedback in the secular evolution of the Milky Way, offering a valuable paradigm for investigating gas cycles in external galaxies."}

Using both the worldline effective field theory for extended gravitating bodies and second-order perturbations of relativistic stellar models, we derive the nonlinear tidal deformation induced by an external gravito-electric tidal field to quadratic order. Through a suitable matching procedure, we provide for the first time the leading nonlinear tidal corrections to the conservative dynamics and gravitational-wave signal of binary systems. Quadratic Love numbers are enhanced more than the linear ones in the small-compactness limit. Because of this, despite entering the gravitational-wave phase at 8th post-Newtonian (PN) order, the leading quadratic Love number can be as important as the next-to-next-to-leading order linear tidal correction, which enters at 7th PN order, and is larger than the subleading point-particle contribution entering at 4th PN order. In particular, quadratic Love numbers can be as large as ~10% of the linear Love numbers in the late inspiral phase. Our approach provides a framework to also compute the (subleading) nonlinear effects induced by magnetic tidal fields and higher multipole moments, and sets the foundations for incorporating nonlinear tidal effects in high-precision gravitational-wave modeling."}

The gravitational field equations reduce to an algebraic relation between a primary curvature invariant and the electric field strength, while the remaining dynamics is governed by a Gauss--law constraint for a point--like charge in the auxiliary space. This correspondence provides a transparent interpretation of higher--curvature gravitational interactions in terms of non--linear gauge dynamics and explains the absence of higher--derivative terms in the reduced equations. As illustrative examples, we apply the formalism to Born--Infeld and Hayward--type models, obtaining higher--dimensional regular black--hole solutions with a de~Sitter--like core. Our results extend the scope of the double--copy paradigm beyond Einstein gravity and suggest a unifying framework for a broad class of higher--curvature theories."}

The recent observation of multiple quasinormal modes (QNMs) in GW250114 marks a major advance for observational black hole spectroscopy. This clear signal, together with the growing number of GW detections, highlights the need for accurate predictions of QNM spectra in beyond-GR theories in order to carry out precision searches for new physics. In this work, we continue to lay the foundation for such predictions using a modified Teukolsky formalism in conjunction with the eigenvalue perturbation method. We compute the spectral shifts of slowly rotating Johannsen-Psaltis black holes for $2 \\leq \\ell \\leq 10$, all $m$, and overtones $n = 0, 1, 2$, and confirm the large-$\\ell$ behavior of the modes by comparing with the WKB approximation. We find that these black holes admit definite-parity modes but break the isospectrality between even- and odd-parity QNMs at all spins, and that the shifts depend linearly on $m$ for slow spins. We further derive a general parity condition that any beyond-GR modification to the metric must satisfy to support definite-parity modes, providing new insights into isospectrality breaking and parity structure in gravitational perturbations."}

From the hydrodynamic and matched dark-matter-only runs, we measure a comprehensive list of halo properties describing density structure, angular momentum, shape, assembly history, and environment. Using the morphological decomposition developed in Paper I, we quantify the sizes, scale heights, and mass fractions of the disk components for galaxies at $0 \\le z \\le 4$. Random Forest (RF) regression shows halo properties alone predict disk size and thickness with high accuracy, while Symbolic Regression (SR) provides compact empirical relations with slightly lower accuracy. Disk height is consistently easier to predict than disk size, and lower-mass halos yield higher accuracy than massive halos. Predictions based on halo properties measured in the full-physics hydro simulations outperform those based on the matched dark-matter-only halos, reflecting the imprint of baryonic restructuring on the inner halo. SHAP analysis reveals that the most informative halo parameters include concentration, Einasto shape, global and inner spin, and recent mass accretion, though their importance varies across disk properties. We show that correlations between disk size and the density-profile shape arise primarily from disk-induced modification of the inner halo, rather than a primordial connection. Finally, we point out that disks become more extended with respect to their host halos at higher redshift in low-mass halos, while massive high-redshift halos show the opposite trend. We provide SR-based prescriptions that accurately map halo properties to disk structures, offering practical tools for galaxy-halo modeling."}

Within this inclusive perspective the spectral energy density of the gravitons is sharply suppressed in the aHz region even though the high frequency signal can be comparatively much larger both in the kHz and GHz domains. For there are no direct tests on the expansion rate prior to the formation of the light nuclei, a modified postinflationary timeline affects the total number of $e$-folds and additionally suppresses the tensor to scalar ratio by making the relic signals effectively invisible in the aHz range. The expansion rate prior to nucleosynthesis is further bounded by the evolution of the hypercharge field and the large-scale magnetism also constrains the decelerated expansion rate. The magnetogenesis requirements are compatible with a potentially detectable spectral energy density of the relic gravitons between the MHz and the THz while the tensor to scalar ratio remains suppressed in the aHz region. A maximum of the spectral energy density of the gravitons in the audio domain leads instead to a larger magnetic field when the scale of the gravitational collapse of the protogalaxy (of the order of the Mpc) gets comparable with the Hubble radius before equality. Along a converse viewpoint the results obtained here imply that a long decelerated stage expanding faster than radiation does not affect the high frequency range but reduces the effective number of $e$-folds by so enhancing the tensor to scalar ratio, possibly beyond its observational limit."}

Intensity mapping of atomic and molecular lines, such as $[\\mathrm{CII}]$ and CO J-ladder transitions, across a broad redshift range is a powerful tool for investigating star formation history, metallicity, the distribution of gas and dust, and the physical conditions within galaxies. Additionally, 21\\,cm line intensity mapping directly probes the neutral hydrogen content in the intergalactic medium, offering a unique window into the timing and morphology of reionization. In this study, we explore the cross-correlation between the 21\\,cm signal and multi-line intensity mapping (LIM) to forecast their detectability for next-generation experiments. Our analysis emphasizes the complementary potential of these techniques to constrain parameters such as the minimum mass of ionizing sources and the ionization fraction $x_e$. Cross-correlations with LIM also enable constraints on physical properties like metal enrichment and the relationship between star formation rates and multi-line luminosities. Using mock observations from Square Kilometre Array (SKA)-low 21\\,cm and Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST)-like LIM experiments, we find that the $[\\mathrm{CII}]$--21\\,cm cross-correlation can constrain reionization history by measuring $x_e$ across multiple redshift bins with significance levels ranging from 9 to 40$σ$. We extend our analysis to CO transitions, showing that the CO(1-0)--21\\,cm cross-correlation provides competitive constraints on reionization parameters. The synergies explored here will enable robust constraints on both reionization and LIM parameters, maximizing the scientific return of current and next-generation intensity mapping experiments."}

Connecting the distribution of baryonic matter and energy across these scales will remain one of the key challenges for both theoretical and observational astrophysics in the coming decade. A major development towards meeting this challenge has been the growing ability to obtain highly spatially resolved (parsec-scale) integral-field spectroscopic observations (e.g. with VLT/MUSE), as well as to probe the extremely low-surface brightness outskirts of galaxies at large radii and high vertical scale heights. To combine the two regimes, we need a paradigm shift in the way we do spectroscopy on galaxies, especially considering the ongoing and future photometric surveys. The next decade will also bring a revolution in extensive photometric surveys of large areas of the sky, uncovering low surface brightness features around nearby galaxies. However, to fully understand the processes that connect galaxies to their haloes, shape low surface brightness features, and drive secular evolution, spatially resolved spectroscopy will be essential. Here, we outline the need for wide-field spectroscopic observations of statistically significant samples of nearby galaxies and highlight the key questions that can only be addressed with such data"}

This system exhibits an extreme black-hole-to-stellar mass ratio and unusually low metallicity, posing significant challenges to BH seeding models. Motivated by these discoveries, we perform high-resolution cosmological simulations with a massive primordial black hole (PBH; $M_{\\rm BH}=5\\times10^7\\,M_\\odot$) seed, incorporating for the first time a fully coupled treatment of PBH accretion, BH feedback, and Population~III/II star formation and stellar feedback. Although PBHs accelerate structure formation through the seed effect, the associated strong thermal feedback from the accretion delays the onset of star formation to $z\\lesssim 10$, producing short, bursty episodes throughout the subsequent evolution. PBH-driven outflows expel enriched gas from the nucleus, while sustained inflows from the intergalactic medium continuously replenish pristine material.

Some outflows show discrete clumps of cold molecular gas moving at extremely high velocities (EHVs) of $\\sim$100 km s$^{-1}$, known as ''molecular bullets'', that are likely closely associated with their primary driving agent. Here we present ALMA CO(J=3-2) observations of a bright EHV molecular bullet that reveal its morphology in detail down to scales of 30 au and its kinematic structure across the entire intermediate velocity range ($\\sim$30-100 km s$^{-1}$). These provide important new insights into how outflows transfer mass and momentum to the surrounding medium. The observed channel maps display several sequences of ring-like features whose velocity increases and size decreases with projected distance from the driving source, each sequence tracing a thin, bow-shaped shell culminating on-axis in a bright EHV head. The shape, kinematics, and mass of each shell all agree remarkably well with the simplest textbook models of momentum-conserving bowshocks produced by a time-variable EHV jet. The dynamical timescale between consecutive shells is of a few decades, with the latest ejection event coinciding with the protostar optical/IR outburst observed in $\\sim$1990. The very strong evidence for bowshock-driven entrainment induced by jet variability revealed by this work suggests that accretion bursts, and therefore variations in the disk snowlines, should occur on decade timescales, which could substantially impact grain growth and planet formation."}

In galaxies with weak or ambiguous AGN signatures, some studies attribute the radio emission to star formation, while others propose AGN-driven winds or weak, unresolved jets as the dominant mechanism. To investigate this connection, we take a step back and analyze a sample of star-forming (SF) galaxies with no clear current AGN signatures. Using low-(LOFAR, 144MHz) and high-frequency (FIRST, 1.4GHz) surveys, combined with spatially resolved spectroscopy from the MaNGA survey, we compare SF galaxies with 144 MHz detections that either do or do not have GHz detections. Despite being matched in stellar mass, redshift, and radio (MHz) luminosity, GHz-detected SF galaxies systematically differ from their non-GHz-detected counterparts. The former display enhanced ionized gas-emission line widths, higher central outflow fractions, redder colors, increased central obscuration, and offset emission-line ratios that shift towards (or closer to) the AGN regime (in the [NII] BPT diagram). Furthermore, the non-GHz galaxies are likely undetected due to their extended radio morphologies, while the GHz-detected ones are significantly more radio compact. Most of the properties from the GHz-detected (compared to non-detected) remarkably resemble the behavior found in many studies of radio-detected AGNs. This suggests that the underlying physical mechanisms shaping GHz-detected SF galaxies properties are fundamentally similar. This raises intriguing questions about whether some compact SF galaxies represent a precursor phase of AGN evolution or a form of low-power AGN. The radio compact characteristic sizes of GHz-detected SF galaxies also suggest a connection between AGN and old starburst galaxies."}

We present a homogeneous, aperture-photometry SED of the Milky Way near-twin NGC~3521 from the ultraviolet to the radio decameter range. Fluxes are measured within a fixed elliptical isophotal aperture using GALEX, SDSS, WISE, Spitzer/MIPS, Herschel/PACS+SPIRE, and VLA data, and supplemented by meter/decameter constraints. We report new observations obtained in Jan-Feb 2022 with the Ukrainian T-shape radio telescope and derive, for the first time, an upper limit in the 24--32~MHz band. The UV-to-decameter SED (27 points) is modelled with \\textsc{CIGALE}, including a dedicated low-frequency radio prescription (\\texttt{radio_extra}) that accounts for emission and absorption effects. Using ZTF and NEOWISE data (2014--2025), we detect genuine nuclear variability; optical trends at $\\sim2^{\\prime\\prime}$ primarily trace the compact nucleus, while NEOWISE variability reflects a mix of nuclear changes and warm-dust emission within the larger aperture. The preferred fit yields $M_\\star \\simeq 6.0\\times10^{10},M_\\odot$, ${\\rm SFR}\\simeq1.65,M_\\odot,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$, $M_{\\rm dust}\\simeq1.3\\times10^{8},M_\\odot$, and an effective dust temperature of $\\sim23$~K. The decameter constraint gives $S_{28,{\\rm MHz}}<11.22$~Jy, consistent with expectations for a Milky Way-like system placed at 10.7~Mpc. We conclude that an integrated, homogeneous SED, especially below 100~MHz, provides a complementary diagnostic for identifying and validating MWAs and for interpreting how Milky Way properties would appear to an external observer."}

A subset of these interactions can lead to stellar mergers, where the two components of a stellar binary system come close enough to coalesce into a single star. Accurately modeling stellar mergers requires computationally expensive 3D methods, which are not suited for exploring large parameter spaces as required e.g., by population synthesis studies. In this work, we compare two 1D prescriptions based on the concept of entropy sorting to their 3D counterparts. We employ a basic entropy sorting method ('ES'), which builds the merger remnant by sorting the progenitor stars' shells by increasing entropy, and a Python version of the 'Make Me A Massive Star' code ('PM'), which additionally applies a shock-heating prescription calibrated on SPH simulations of stellar head-on collisions. Comparing to a set of 39 more recent SPH head-on collisions different from the ones used for PM calibration, we find that PM reproduces the outcome of these mergers a lot better than ES in terms of thermal and composition structure post-merger.\n  Both 1D methods produce remnants that are rejuvenated more strongly than expected for massive stars, indicating that increased amounts of hydrogen are being mixed into the core. In an effort to further improve PM, we introduce a scaling factor for the shock-heating. We compare 1D models with both down- and up-scaled heating to a 3D MHD $9 + 8\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ merger of main-sequence stars. Decreasing the shock-heating improves the agreement in terms of the entropy profile, but has only a minor impact on the subsequent stellar evolution of the remnant. We find that 1D methods are able to approximate 3D stellar merger simulations well, and that shock-heating has to be considered to properly predict the post-merger structures."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "A recent study of the compact elliptical galaxy NGC 4486B using JWST-NIRSpec IFU kinematics confirmed a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass $M_{BH}=3.6\\pm0.7\\times10^8$ (~8% of the stellar mass). In addition to its double nucleus, the nuclear kinematics show pronounced asymmetries: a velocity-dispersion peak displaced by 6 pc from the galaxy center and a ~16 km/s offset in the mean stellar line-of-sight velocity near the SMBH. We examine the origin of the 12 pc double nucleus and these asymmetries and show that the observations favor an SMBH surrounded by an eccentric nuclear disk (END). END formation models require the SMBH to experience a gravitational wave (GW) recoil following a binary SMBH merger. Our orbit-superposition models contain ~50% retrograde stars at the edge of the nuclear region, in striking agreement with END-formation simulations. We infer a pre-merger mass ratio q>0.15 and a recoil kick of ~340 km/s. Our N-body simulations show that with such a kick, the SMBH returns to the center within ~30 Myr. Its flat central core is also consistent with earlier binary black hole scouring. We test two alternative mechanisms-buoyancy-driven oscillations and a pre-merger SMBH binary-but neither reproduces the observed offsets, favoring the GW-kick scenario. Our direct N-body simulations further show that a prograde SMBH binary in a rotating host can stall in a corotation resonance, delaying coalescence. Thus, although NGC 4486B is an old, relaxed galaxy near the Virgo cluster center, its SMBH appears to have merged only recently, making its nucleus a rare nearby laboratory for studying post-merger SMBH dynamics."}

Here we develop an efficient framework, HOLCon (Halo Optimised Lightcone Constructor), for post-facto construction of dark matter halo lightcones from simulations and use them to generate a mock galaxy catalogue. HOLCon includes a module to optimise the lightcone's orientation within the simulation box, minimising repeated structures when the survey volume exceeds a single box -- a common challenge in modern surveys. A linear interpolation scheme tracks the evolution of halo properties across snapshots. Applied to the publicly available Uchuu simulation, we construct a lightcone of 50 ${\\rm deg}^2$ and extending up to $z = 10$, providing representative coverage of deep fields of Stage IV surveys. We validate the lightcone for cosmological applications by comparing the dark matter halo clustering in the lightcone with those from the original simulation snapshots. Subsequently, we make the galaxy-halo connection on the lightcone with a redshift extended version of the SciPIC algorithm producing a comprehensive set of descriptive galaxy attributes. HOLCon leverages Dask, a scalable parallel computing pythonic framework for fast construction of dark matter halo lightcones enabling rapid creation of multiple statistical realizations essential for robust cosmological inference. The produced galaxy mock makes predictions for clustering of H$α$ emitters, making it a useful cosmology resource."}
