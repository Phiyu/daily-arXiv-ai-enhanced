We report the first-ever constraints on such sources based on cosmic microwave background (CMB) $B$-mode polarization measurements. Using data from BICEP/Keck, SPTpol, SPT-3G, Planck, and WMAP, we constrain the amplitude of an early causal tensor (ECT) power spectrum parameterized by $r_{ect}$, the ratio of causal tensor power to total scalar power at $k~=~0.01$ Mpc$^{-1}$, and obtain a 95% CL upper limit of $r_{ect}<$ 0.0077. Since $r_{ect}$ can easily be related to the parameters of a given theory, our bound robustly constrains a broad class of well-motivated gravitational wave sources in the early universe, including first-order cosmological phase transitions, enhanced small-scale density perturbations, and various topological defects. Finally, we translate our limit into a bound on the present-day energy density in gravitational waves at ultra-low frequencies otherwise inaccessible to traditional gravitational wave detection strategies, including pulsar timing arrays, interferometers, and resonant cavities."}

While the microphysical details may differ, as long as these sources are bounded in duration and correlation length, their tensor power spectra exhibit a universal scaling behavior at small wavenumber: $P_h(k) \\propto k^3$, corresponding to white noise on super-horizon scales at the time of production. If these early causal tensor sources (ECTs) exclusively produce gravitational waves before redshift $z \\sim 10^5$, this scaling is realized on all of the scales observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and thus yields a universal multipole distribution for the $B$-mode angular power spectrum. Unlike the scale-invariant distributions of inflationary $B$ modes, ECTs generically predict enhanced power on small scales and suppressed power on large scales, which allows these source classes to be distinguished given measurements over a sufficient range of angular scales. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for characterizing ECTs and demonstrate how their universal infrared scaling manifests in low-frequency observables, including CMB $B$ modes and stochastic gravitational wave spectral densities. We illustrate this mapping with representative case studies of this universality class involving first-order phase transitions, topological defects, and enhanced scalar perturbations, which source tensor modes at second order in perturbation theory."}

This particular form of EoS was first proposed by S. Saha and K. Bamba in 2019 and has two parameters, $θ_1$ and $θ_2$, which must be determined from observations. To this end, we place limits on these parameters by combining recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data -- including measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) -- with Type Ia supernova observations from the Pantheon+ compilation, along with direct determinations of the Hubble parameter. From this combined analysis, we obtain a best-fit value for the Hubble parameter, $H_0 = 67.4 \\pm 1.2~\\text{km\\,s}^{-1}\\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, while current measurements of the sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch yield $r_d = 146\\pm 2.5$~Mpc. Furthermore, we study the evolution of the deceleration parameter, the effective EoS, and the jerk parameter, and support our findings using the $Om(z)$ diagnostic. The model exhibits noticeable deviations from the predictions of the concordance $Λ$CDM model. Despite these differences, our results indicate that the model provides a coherent description of late-time cosmic evolution and the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe.

We aim to decompose the EBL into its principal constituents using multi-band intensity mapping combined with cosmic shear and galaxy clustering. We develop a joint halo-model framework in which IHL follows a mass- and redshift-dependent luminosity scaling, IGL is set by an evolving Schechter luminosity function, and EoR emission is modelled with Pop II/III stellar emissivities and a binned star-formation efficiency. Using mock surveys in a flat $Λ$CDM cosmology with ten spectral bands spanning 0.75-5.0$\\rm μm$ in the NEP deep fields over about 100$°^2$ with source detections down to AB=20.5 for masking, and six redshift bins to $z=2.5$, we fit auto- and cross-power spectra using a MCMC method.

Cross-correlations reveal a stronger coupling of IHL than IGL to the shear field, enhancing component separation; conversely, the EoR contribution shows negligible correlation with cosmic shear and galaxy clustering, aiding its isolation in the EBL. Relative to the SPHEREx EBL-only case, the inferred IHL fraction as a function of halo mass is significantly tightened over $10^{11}-10^{14} M_{\\odot}$, with uncertainties reduced by 5-30%, and the resulting star-formation rate density constraints extend to $z\\sim 11$, with uncertainty reductions of 22-31%."}

The characteristic spacing of these cores is a key observable imprint of fragmentation physics and is commonly measured using nearest-neighbour (NN) statistics. However, NN separations are derived from projected two-dimensional (2D) positions, while fragmentation occurs in three dimensions (3D). Using spherical and fractal toy models, we show that the standard geometric deprojection factor of $4/π\\simeq1.27$ is inadequate because projection not only foreshortens separations but also rewires the NN network, while finite angular resolution merges close neighbours and inflates apparent spacings. We quantify these competing biases with Monte Carlo experiments spanning a wide range of morphologies, sample sizes, and effective resolutions. From these we derive an empirical correction factor that depends on both sample size and resolution: for small ($N\\lesssim10$) or poorly resolved samples ($\\lesssim$10 resolution elements across the field), intrinsic NN spacings exceed projected values by only 20 to 40%, whereas for well-sampled ($N\\gtrsim100$), well-resolved data ($\\gtrsim$30-50 resolution elements), true 3D separations are typically larger by a factor of $\\sim$2. This calibration enables observers to convert measured 2D NN spacings into corresponding 3D estimates, with typical morphology-driven uncertainties of order 30 to 40%, and we demonstrate how it alters inferred fragmentation scales in observed and simulated core populations.

In this formulation, the cosmological conformal factor is not a propagating degree of freedom but a global gauge variable fixed by the Hamiltonian constraint, rendering the conventional conformal-factor problem inapplicable. Thermal equilibrium at cosmological turning points uniquely fixes the equilibrium phase density ($Λ=R/6$) as the integrating factor that renders the horizon Clausius relation exact. Controlled departures from equilibrium are encoded by a single variance parameter governing non-adiabatic background evolution. The resulting framework clarifies the conceptual status of $Λ$CDM, explains the emergence of effective $w$CDM behavior--including phantom regimes without new degrees of freedom--and provides a natural origin for late-time cosmological tensions, arising from global constraints that preclude a stable de Sitter state."}

In such scenarios, however, a phantom-divide crossing, as recently suggested by DESI observations, is not achieved without encountering theoretical inconsistencies. We incorporate a canonical scalar field with a potential, in addition to the vector field, and show that the phantom-divide crossing from $w_{\\rm DE} < -1$ to $w_{\\rm DE} > -1$ can occur at low redshifts. We propose a minimal model that admits such a transition and identify the region of parameter space in which all dynamical degrees of freedom in the scalar, vector, and tensor sectors are free from ghost and Laplacian instabilities. We further investigate the evolution of linear cosmological perturbations by applying the quasi-static approximation to modes well inside the Hubble radius. The dimensionless quantities $μ$ and $Σ$, which characterize the growth of matter perturbations and the bending of light rays, respectively, depend on the sound speed $c_ψ$ of the longitudinal scalar perturbation associated with the vector field. Since $c_ψ$ is influenced by the transverse vector mode, the model exhibits sufficient flexibility to yield values of $μ$ and $Σ$ close to 1. Consequently, unlike theories such as scalar Galileons, the present model can be consistent with observations of redshift-space distortions and integrated Sachs-Wolfe-galaxy cross-correlations."}

So far, the most direct evidence for BH*s comes from a handful of sources where the host galaxy is completely outshone as suggested by their remarkably steep Balmer breaks. Here we present a novel scheme to disentangle BH*s from their host galaxies assuming that the [OIII]5008Å line arises exclusively from the host. Using a sample of 98 LRDs ($z$~$2-9$) with high quality NIRSpec/PRISM spectra, we demonstrate that the host-subtracted median stack displays a Balmer break $>2\\times$ stronger than massive quiescent galaxies, with the rest-optical continuum resembling a blackbody-like SED ($T_{\\rm{eff}}$~$4050$ K, $\\log(L_{\\rm{bol}})$~$43.9$ erg s$^{-1}$, $R_{\\rm{eff}}$~$1300$ au). We measure a steep Balmer decrement (H$α$/H$β>10$) and numerous density-sensitive features (e.g., FeII, HeI, OI). These are hallmark signatures of dense gas envelopes, providing population-level evidence that BH*s indeed power LRDs. In the median LRD, BH*s account for $\\sim20\\%$ of the UV emission, $\\sim50\\%$ at the Balmer break, and $\\sim90\\%$ at wavelengths longer than H$α$ with the remainder arising from the host. BH*s preferentially reside in low-mass galaxies ($M_{\\rm{\\star}}$~$10^{8}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\rm{\\odot}}$) undergoing recent starbursts, as evidenced by extreme emission line EWs (e.g., [OIII]5008Å~$1100$Å, CIII]~$12$Å), thereby favoring BH* origins linked to star-formation. We show V-shaped LRD selections are biased to high BH*/host fractions ($\\gtrsim60\\%$ at 5500Å) -- less dominant BH*s may be powering JWST's blue broad-line AGN. We find BH*s are so commonplace and transient (duty cycle $\\sim1\\%$, lifetime $\\sim10$ Myrs) that every massive black hole may have once shone as a BH*."}

Bursty star formation histories (SFHs), characterized by short-term fluctuations in the star formation rate (SFR), may explain this diversity, but constraining burst timescales and amplitudes in individual galaxies is challenging due to degeneracies and sensitivity limits. We introduce a population-level simulation-based inference framework that recovers the power and timescales of SFR fluctuations by forward-modeling galaxy populations and distributions of rest-UV to rest-optical spectral features sensitive to star formation timescales. We adopt a stochastic SFH model based on a power spectral density formalism spanning 1 Myr-10 Gyr. Using simulated samples of N=500 galaxies at z~4 with typical JWST/NIRSpec uncertainties, we demonstrate that: (i) the power of SFR fluctuations can be measured with sufficient precision to distinguish between simulations (e.g., FIRE-2-like vs. Illustris-like populations at >99% confidence for timescales < 100 Myr); (ii) simultaneously modeling stochastic fluctuations and the recent (t_L < 500 Myr) average SFH slope is essential, as secular trends otherwise mimic burstiness in common diagnostics; (iii) frequent, intense bursts impose an outshining limit, and bias inference toward underestimating burstiness due to the obscuration of long-timescale power; and (iv) the power of SFR fluctuations can be inferred to 95% confidence across all timescales in both smooth and bursty populations. This framework establishes a novel and robust method for placing quantitative constraints on the feedback physics regulating star formation using large, uniformly selected spectroscopic samples."}

In the canonical ensemble, we identify a critical electric charge $Q_c$ separating a regime exhibiting a first-order small/large black-hole (SBH/LBH) phase transition from a regime with a single thermodynamically stable phase. For both massless and massive probes, the thermal profile of the Lyapunov exponent $λ(T)$ becomes multivalued in the SBH/LBH coexistence region and exhibits a finite discontinuity at the transition temperature. This jump vanishes continuously as $Q \\to Q_c$, signaling the termination of the first-order transition at a second-order critical point. Near criticality, the Lyapunov discontinuity obeys a universal mean-field scaling law with critical exponent $1/2$. For massless probes, we further analyze the critical impact parameter $b_c$, which displays the same multivalued structure and critical behavior as the Lyapunov exponent. We also demonstrate that the spinodal temperatures, defined by the extrema of the $T(r_h)$ curve where the heat capacity at fixed charge diverges, coincide with singular features in the Lyapunov exponent. Our results identify the Lyapunov exponent as a unified dynamical probe capable of capturing both first-order phase coexistence and second-order critical behavior in black-hole thermodynamics."}

Using a halo-based model in which free-electron density profiles are drawn from the hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG-300 (TNG300), we show that the null signal at $R \\sim 0.01\\, h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$ is inconsistent with the TNG300 prediction. This discrepancy indicates that the hot-gas mass fraction in halos with masses of $10^{12-13}\\, M_\\odot$ hosting 2MASS galaxies must be lower than that predicted by TNG300. A simple phenomenological modification of the TNG300 model suggests that the hot-gas mass fraction in halos of $10^{12-13}\\, M_\\odot$ should be below $\\sim 10\\%$ of the global baryon fraction in the nearby universe, implying the need for stronger feedback in this mass range. Our constraints are consistent with those inferred from X-ray emission and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements in galaxies, while providing a direct estimate of the hot-gas mass fraction that does not rely on electron-temperature measurements. These results demonstrate that galaxy-FRB cross correlations offer a powerful probe of feedback processes in galaxy formation."}

The effect of internal properties and galaxy interactions on bar pattern speeds", "comment": "18 pages, 12 figures including appendices, submitted to MNRAS", "summary": "One of the main properties of galactic bars is their rotation (or pattern) speed, which is driven by both internal galactic properties, as well as external interactions. To assess the influence of these internal and external drivers on bar rotation in a cosmological setting, we use the Auriga suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations. We calculate the bar pattern speed and the bar rotation rate - the ratio of corotation radius to bar length - at the time of bar formation and at z=0, and compare these to bar age, bar strength, baryon dominance, galaxy stellar mass, and the history of external galaxy interactions. We find that galaxies which are more baryon dominated at z=0 - and which lie above the observed stellar mass-halo mass abundance matching relation - host faster bars, while more dark matter dominated galaxies host slower bars. Baryon-dominated galaxies also form their bars earlier and their rotation rates stay constant or even decrease over time; this leads to older bars being faster than their younger counterparts - in contrast to the expectation of bar slow-down from dynamical friction imparted by the dark matter halo. We also find a trend in stellar mass, with 'faster' bars being hosted in more massive galaxies, which could be driven by the underlying higher baryon-dominance of more massive galaxies. Furthermore, we find that external interactions, such as mergers and flybys, correlate with lower bar rotation rates, particularly for strong interactions that occur around bar formation time. This correlation is relatively weak, leaving internal baryon-dominance as the main driver of fast bar rotation rates."}

While time-delay cosmography using quadruply lensed GW events associated with optical images of the lens systems can provide precise measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), they are considered to be much rarer than doubly lensed events. In this work, we analyze time-delay cosmography with doubly lensed GW events for the first time. We generate mock doubly lensed GW events with designed sensitivity of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O5 network, with LIGO post-O5 upgrade, and with Einstein Telescope (ET) + Cosmic Explorer (CE) respectively, and select the events that can be associated with future galaxy surveys. Over 1000 realizations, we find an average of 0.2(2.4) qualified events with the LVK O5(post-O5) network. Whereas with the ET+CE network, we find an average of 73.2 qualified events over 100 realizations. Using the Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS) lens model, we jointly estimate waveform parameters and the impact parameter with doubly lensed GW signals, and then forecast the constraints on cosmological parameters and modified GW propagation by combining time-delay cosmography and the standard siren approach. The average posterior gives a constraint on $H_0$ with a relative uncertainty of $14\\%$, $10\\%$ and $0.42\\%$ in the $Λ$CDM model for the LVK O5, LVK post-O5, and ET+CE network, respectively.

To investigate how Haro 11's properties arise, we perform a radiation hydrodynamics simulation of the merger, and create mock observations of LyC, Ly$α$, and H$α$, from which we compute their luminosities ($L$) and escape fractions ($f_{\\rm esc}$). We track these quantities along multiple sightlines as the two progenitor galaxies merge, from the first interaction until the system resembles present-day Haro 11. We find that $L$ and $f_{\\rm esc}$ vary by 1-2 orders of magnitude for LyC due to sightline variations. At the two pericentre passages, the total $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC}$ increases by roughly an order of magnitude. Conversely, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm Lyα}$ shows a moderate increase at the pericentre passages, which affects the inference of LyC properties from Ly$α$. We attribute this to a displacement of the LyC-emitting stars relative to the \\Lya-emitting gas, combined with an increased density from gas compression. Furthermore, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC}$ is boosted during star formation bursts, likely due to stellar feedback. As direct comparison with Haro 11, the simulation qualitatively matches its morphology and luminosities. We find that among the dense stellar knots, knot C is the main contributor to both intrinsic and escaping LyC emission. Additionally, the Ly$α$ spectra displays distinct features found in observations, implying similar gas conditions are present."}

As an example, we consider the detectability of low lying dynamical tides in binary neutron star or neutron star black hole mergers. Tidal forces can excite oscillatory modes of one or both of the stars in the binary when the orbital frequency of the binary system sweeps through the resonant mode frequency dissipating energy into the vibrational mode. The orbital energy loss to the vibrational mode extracts energy from the orbital motion, advancing the time to merger. The inspiral then continues with an excess phase and a time advance. Both will cause a mismatch when fitting to a system that has not gone through the resonance. To resolve this effect, we compute the mismatch for current and planned detectors using both a quasi-analytical approach that relies on the computation of moment integrals and an optimized version of the standard numerical match function. We conclude that detectability can occur for time advances of the order of 1 ms with advanced LVK detectors for an excess energy-flux that is a few percent of the gravitational wave emission. Our results contrast with previous work, which model this effect solely as a phase shift of the waveform or by using the difference in the number of cycles induced by the resonant behavior. We show that tidal resonance effects primarily cause a time advance of the merger, rather than a phase difference, and that the single-frequency approximation commonly used in the literature significantly overestimates the detectability of this effect."}

In this Letter we propose a new, purely geometric null test of the late-time expansion history that is exactly independent of the Hubble constant. By combining strong-lensing time-delay distances with gravitational-wave standard-siren luminosity distances, we construct a dimensionless ratio that depends only on the redshift dependence of the expansion rate and can be both predicted from early-Universe data and measured directly at late times, without relying on the cosmic distance ladder or the sound horizon. We show that the comparison between the early- and late-time determinations of this ratio provides a transparent consistency test of the standard cosmological expansion. When combined with an independent standard-siren measurement of $H_{0}$, this framework allows one to unambiguously distinguish between early- and late-time origins of the Hubble tension. With the forthcoming detection of lensed gravitational-wave standard sirens, the proposed test provides a timely and robust framework for probing this long-standing cosmological puzzle."}

We reconstructed the star-formation history (SFH) of 59 early-type galaxies (ETGs) within the sample, through the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code CIGALE and state-of-the-art stellar population (SP) models to reproduce the galactic UV emission from hot, old, low-mass stars (i.e. the UV upturn).

In agreement with our previous work on Virgo ETGs, we found that (i) the majority of ETGs needs the presence of an UV upturn to explain their FUV emission, with temperatures $\\langle T_{\\rm UV}\\rangle$~33800 K; (ii) ETGs have grown their stellar masses quickly, with SF timescales $τ\\lesssim 1500$ Myr.

This study can be extended to ETGs in the 14000 deg$^2$ extragalactic sky that will soon be observed by Euclid, in combination with those from other major upcoming surveys (e.g. Rubin/LSST), and UV observations, to ultimately assess whether the nearby massive ETGs represent the progeny of the massive high-z JWST red quiescent galaxies."}

Quantum fluctuations in the particle motion and in the field prevent signaling or violations of quantum mechanics in this setup. We reformulate this thought experiment by considering gravitational waves emitted by an extended quadrupolar object as a detector for Newtonian tidal fields. We find that quantum fluctuations in the gravitational waves prevent signaling. In the Newtonian limit, rotating black holes behave as extended quadrupolar objects, as consequence of the strong equivalence principle. It follows that consistency of the Newtonian limit of general relativity with quantum mechanics requires the quantization of gravitational radiation, even when the waves originate in strong gravity sources."}

We demonstrate that a lunar-based laser interferometer, such as the proposed Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA), can directly probe the sound speed of dark energy by measuring the real-time evolution of horizon-scale gravitational potentials. Operating in the ultra-low-frequency gravitational band inaccessible from Earth, LILA is sensitive to scalar metric perturbations sourced by dark energy dynamics. Using both fluid and effective field theory descriptions, we develop a complete framework linking dark energy sound speed to observable strain signatures. We construct a likelihood pipeline and Fisher forecasts, showing that LILA can either detect clustering dark energy or exclude broad classes of models with unprecedented sensitivity. This establishes lunar interferometry as a novel and powerful probe of the physics driving cosmic acceleration."}

Main results in Figs. 5 (BH* stack), 12 (explanation of the LRD SED), and 15 (hidden BH*s in blue galaxies). Comments warmly welcomed!", "summary": "The central engines of Little Red Dots (LRDs) may be ``black hole stars\" (BH*s), early stages of black hole growth characterized by dense gas envelopes. So far, the most direct evidence for BH*s comes from a handful of sources where the host galaxy is completely outshone as suggested by their remarkably steep Balmer breaks. Here we present a novel scheme to disentangle BH*s from their host galaxies assuming that the [OIII]5008Å line arises exclusively from the host. Using a sample of 98 LRDs ($z$~$2-9$) with high quality NIRSpec/PRISM spectra, we demonstrate that the host-subtracted median stack displays a Balmer break $>2\\times$ stronger than massive quiescent galaxies, with the rest-optical continuum resembling a blackbody-like SED ($T_{\\rm{eff}}$~$4050$ K, $\\log(L_{\\rm{bol}})$~$43.9$ erg s$^{-1}$, $R_{\\rm{eff}}$~$1300$ au). We measure a steep Balmer decrement (H$α$/H$β>10$) and numerous density-sensitive features (e.g., FeII, HeI, OI). These are hallmark signatures of dense gas envelopes, providing population-level evidence that BH*s indeed power LRDs. In the median LRD, BH*s account for $\\sim20\\%$ of the UV emission, $\\sim50\\%$ at the Balmer break, and $\\sim90\\%$ at wavelengths longer than H$α$ with the remainder arising from the host. BH*s preferentially reside in low-mass galaxies ($M_{\\rm{\\star}}$~$10^{8}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\rm{\\odot}}$) undergoing recent starbursts, as evidenced by extreme emission line EWs (e.g., [OIII]5008Å~$1100$Å, CIII]~$12$Å), thereby favoring BH* origins linked to star-formation. We show V-shaped LRD selections are biased to high BH*/host fractions ($\\gtrsim60\\%$ at 5500Å) -- less dominant BH*s may be powering JWST's blue broad-line AGN. We find BH*s are so commonplace and transient (duty cycle $\\sim1\\%$, lifetime $\\sim10$ Myrs) that every massive black hole may have once shone as a BH*."}

We find negative colour gradients for both galaxies with and without tidal features and find that tidal feature-hosting red sequence galaxies have redder outskirts than their non-tidal feature hosting counterparts, consistent with the outskirts of these galaxies being dominated by stars accreted from gas-poor minor mergers. We find decreasing mass ratios of tidal features-to-host galaxy with increasing galaxy stellar mass, suggesting that less massive galaxies undergo mergers with companions closer in mass than more massive galaxies. Galaxies exhibiting streams have bluer outskirts than those hosting shells, and shells around red sequence galaxies tend to be more massive and have higher mass ratios to their hosts than streams, consistent with streams being formed from mergers with satellites less massive than those responsible for shells. The agreement between our findings and those of other observational and simulation-based works confirms the validity of our methodology and highlights the value of tidal features colours as a probe into the process through which galaxies evolve."}

We also calculate an estimate for the limit on the fractional polarization level of sources with a total intensity below 1mJy (mostly star-forming galaxies) of $\\stackrel{<}{_{\\sim}}$3% using stacking. The mean Faraday Rotation we measure is consistent with that due to the Milky Way. We also show that fractional polarization is correlated with in-band spectral index, consistent with a lower mean fractional polarization for the flat-spectrum population.

In particular, the observed relation between the mass of the most massive star formed in an embedded cluster and the cluster's total stellar mass supports a deterministic sampling process, known as optimal sampling. However, the physical origin of optimal sampling has not been formally established in the literature. In this work, we show that the stellar mass distribution implied by optimal sampling emerges from applying the Maximum Entropy principle to the fragmentation of star-forming clumps, whose structure is set by density-dependent cooling in the optically thin regime. Here, the maximum entropy leads to unbiased distributions. By applying calculus of variations to minimize the entropy functional obtained assuming fragmentation, we recover the power-law form of the sIMF, and we show that any distribution deviating from the sIMF violates the Maximum Entropy principle. This work provides a first-principles foundation for the deterministic nature of star formation. Thus, the sIMF is the distribution resulting from a maximally unbiased system."}

The manuscript includes 13 pages, 12 figures", "summary": "The Nuclear Stellar Disc (NSD) of the Milky Way is a dense, rotating stellar system in the central 200 pc. The NSD is thought to be primarily fuelled by bar-driven gas inflows from the inner Galactic disc. As part of the LEGARE project, we construct the first chemical evolution models for the NSD using a Bayesian approach tailored to reproduce the observed metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) and compared with the available abundance ratios for Mg, Si, Ca relative to Fe. We adopt a state-of-the-art chemical evolution model in which the gas responsible for the formation of the NSD is assumed to be driven by the Galactic bar-induced inflows. The chemical composition of the accreted material is assumed to reflect that of the Galactic disc at a radius of 4 kpc. A Bayesian MCMC framework is used to fit the MDFs of different samples of NSD stars. If we take the NSD data at face value, without considering a possible contamination from bulge stars, we find that a formation scenario based on the inner disc flowing gas is inconsistent with the low metallicity tail of the observed MDF. This is because the inner disc metallicity, at the epoch of bar formation, was already near solar. On the other hand, models invoking dilution from additional metal-poor inflows successfully reproduce the observations. The best-fit model requires inflow metallicity 5 times lower than the inner disc and a moderate star formation efficiency. The same model successfully reproduces the observed [$α$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] ratios and predicts a star formation history consistent with the most recent estimates. However, if we assume that the MDF is contaminated by metal poor bulge stars and restricted to [Fe/H] > -0.3 dex, gas dilution is no longer required. In this case, the best-fit model has a very low star formation efficiency and a mild galactic wind."}

Several methods have been developed to perform rapid Bayesian inference, but they are not yet used to inform our full analyses.

By combining the fast constraints from the simple-pe algorithm with the nested sampling acceleration technique of posterior repartitioning, we demonstrate that our method can guide the nested sampler towards the most probable regions of parameter space more efficiently for signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) greater than 20, while mathematically guaranteeing that the final inference is identical to that of a standard, uninformed analysis. We validate the method through an injection study, demonstrating that it produces statistically robust and unbiased results, whilst providing speedups of up to $2.2\\times$ for binaries with SNRs $< 150$. Importantly, we show that the performance gain provided by our method scales with SNR, establishing it as a powerful technique to mitigate the cost of analysing signals from current and future gravitational-wave observatories."}

Kinematic contaminants such as undetected stellar companions are well under control using various observational diagnostics such as Gaia's ruwe parameter, the color-magnitude diagram, multi-epoch observations of radial velocities, Speckle interferometric follow-up observations, and requiring Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion consistency.

We present a multi-modal deep learning framework that jointly leverages spatial and spectral information from CO observations to infer outflow mass, inclination, and position angle ($PA$). Our model, trained on synthetic ALMA observations generated from 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations, utilizes a cross-attention fusion mechanism to integrate morphological and kinematic features with probabilistic uncertainty estimation. Our results demonstrate that Vision Transformer architectures significantly outperform convolutional networks, showing remarkable robustness to reduced spatial resolution. Interpretability analysis reveals a physically consistent hierarchy: spatial features dominate across all parameters, whereas spectral profiles provide secondary constraints for mass and inclination. Applied to observational ALMA data, the framework delivers stable mass and $PA$ estimates with exceptionally tightly constrained inclination angles.

Recent research indicates a noticeable decline in the rotation curve (RC) of the Milky Way (MW), suggesting the need for a new low-mass model to describe its dynamical features. This study constructs a new Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger model to characterize the RC features of our galaxy. We use the GIZMO code to simulate mergers with various orbital parameters to investigate how the disk warp evolves under different conditions. This simulation demonstrates the evolutionary mechanism of disk warp, which arises due to the asymmetric gravitational potential of the dark matter (DM) halo generated universally by galaxy mergers. The results indicate that the tilt angle of the DM halo partly reflects the gravitational strength at the $Z=0$ plane, while the gravitational strength on the disk plane reflects the amplitude of disk warp. We identify a dual-regime interaction mechanism driven by the asymmetric halo potential. On short timescales, we find a distinct anti-correlation between the halo's tilt angle and the disk's warp amplitude, indicating a `seesaw' mechanism of angular momentum exchange. On secular timescales, however, dynamical friction drives a global alignment, causing both the halo tilt and the warp amplitude to decay simultaneously. Furthermore, we demonstrate that high-inclination mergers can sustain long-lived prograde precession, where the persistent yet decaying gravitational torque maintains the prograde bending mode against differential wind-up."}

Focusing on the ULDM Jeans scale, we identify the critical conditions under which high-redshift baryonic gas, strongly confined by central solitonic cores of the halos, undergoes direct and monolithic collapse. The solitonic potential naturally drives rapid inflow and shock heating, allowing the gas to exceed the critical atomic-cooling and fragmentation-suppression threshold of $\\sim 3 \\times 10^4 {\\rm K}$ without invoking an external UV background. We derive semi-analytic relations for the halo mass, soliton mass, baryonic core radius, and thermodynamic state of the gas, including the effects of baryonic contraction. These relations simultaneously determine the minimum and maximum SMBH seed masses as functions of redshift. In this framework, pristine gas clouds that satisfy the temperature threshold collapse without fragmentation, forming SMBH seeds with characteristic masses of order $\\sim 10^5M_\\odot$, while systems below the threshold are expected to form compact star clusters instead. Our model also implies an upper limit on the attainable SMBH mass, predicting a maximum mass scale of order $\\sim10^{10}M_\\odot$, consistent with the most massive quasars observed to date. The ULDM particle mass required to reproduce the inferred seed mass scale, $m \\simeq 10^{-22}{\\rm eV}$, coincides with the value favored by galactic-scale observations, providing a unified explanation for the characteristic masses of both galactic cores and early SMBH seeds.

Our framework introduces scattering maps prescribed on two classes of hypersurfaces: a gravitational singularity hypersurface and a fluid-discontinuity hypersurface. By analyzing the causal structures induced by the light cone and the acoustic cone, we formulate a local evolution problem for the Einstein-Euler system in the presence of such interfaces. We explain how suitable scattering relations must supplement the field equations in order to ensure uniqueness and thus yield a complete macroscopic description of the evolution. This viewpoint builds on a theory developed in collaboration with G. Veneziano for quiescent (velocity-dominated) singularities in solutions of the Einstein equations coupled to a scalar field, where the passage across the singular hypersurface is encoded by a singularity scattering map. The guiding question is to identify junction prescriptions that are compatible with the Einstein and Euler equations, in particular with the propagation of constraints. The outcome is a rigid set of universal relations, together with a family of model-dependent parameters. Under physically motivated requirements (general covariance, causality, constraint compatibility, and ultra-locality), we aim to classify admissible scattering relations arising from microscopic physics and characterizing, at the macroscopic level, the dynamics of a fluid coupled to Einstein gravity."}

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will deliver multi-band light curves for millions of AGN, enabling variability studies at a true population scale. We synthesize recent results from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which demonstrate that optical variability amplitudes and timescales are primarily regulated by accretion state, with secondary dependence on black hole mass and redshift, and establish the feasibility of survey-driven continuum reverberation mapping. ZTF measurements reveal optical continuum-emitting region sizes that often exceed standard thin disk predictions, implicating diffuse continuum emission from the broad line region as a significant contributor to observed inter-band lags. We evaluate the implications of LSST cadence and survey strategy, particularly the deep drilling fields, for continuum and emission line reverberation mapping, changing-look AGN, extreme variability quasars, and periodic variability searches. Key limitations of broadband photometric variability are identified, including variable emission line contamination, diffuse BLR continuum emission, and cadence-dependent lag recoverability. We argue that realizing LSST's full scientific potential requires community-scale, standardized variability metric pipelines, probabilistic classification integrated with alert brokers for follow-up triggering, and complementary medium-band photometric observations to isolate the accretion disk continuum. Together, these elements will enable LSST to convert photometric variability into quantitative constraints on accretion disks, BLR structure, and supermassive black hole growth across cosmic time."}

The unexpectedly high number density of these systems has triggered intense debate about potential differences in the physical properties of galaxies at such extreme redshifts and those at lower redshift. However, progress has been limited by the lack of rest-frame optical diagnostics, which are critical for constraining the key properties. Here we present deep JWST/MIRI observations of a UV-luminous galaxy at $z=11.04$, CEERS2-588, only 400 Myr after the Big Bang. CEERS2-588 is detected in the MIRI F560W and F770W bands, while deep MIRI/MRS spectroscopy yields no detection of H$α$ or [OIII]$\\lambda5007$ line, revealing a prominent Balmer break detected for the first time at $z>10$. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting indicates an extended star formation history possibly reaching $z>15$, followed by rapid quenching within the recent $\\sim10$ Myr, in stark contrast to other $z>10$ galaxies. The MIRI detections also significantly improve our stellar mass estimate to $\\mathrm{log}(M_*/M_\\odot)=9.1^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$, making CEERS2-588 the most massive galaxy securely confirmed at $z>10$. Remarkably, the inferred gas-phase metallicity is near solar, exceeding predictions from current theoretical models.

We aim to investigate the orbital structure of the unusually large NSC in FCC 47 (NGC 1336) by decomposing its stellar orbits into dynamically distinct components. We extract stellar kinematics, and in particular the line-of-sight velocity distributions (LOSVDs), from VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy using the non-parametric Bayes-LOSVD approach, and apply triaxial Schwarzschild orbit-superposition modelling with the DYNAMITE software. We decompose the orbit library into hot, warm, cold, and counter-rotating components. We detect triple-peaked LOSVDs in the nucleus, indicating a complex orbital structure. The NSC forms a counter-rotating, kinematically decoupled component. A hot pressure-supported component, a warm counter-rotating structure and a counter-rotating cold disk in the centre suggest hierarchical assembly via early star cluster accretion and later in situ star formation.

For the parameter space explored, we find that $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V}$ is a more robust predictor of outcome: type B PBHs form when $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V} \\gtrsim 1$ (critical range $\\sim 1.1 - 1.6$ in our survey), type A PBHs arise when $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V}$ is below this threshold but remains above a lower bound (typical range $\\sim 0.35 - 0.7$), and no-PBH dispersal occurs when $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V}$ falls below this lower bound. When a clear thin-wall FVD boundary exists, $δ(t_\\mathrm{H})$ can correspondingly distinguish different outcomes (roughly $δ_c(t_\\mathrm{H}) \\sim 1 - 1.7$ for type B and $δ_c(t_\\mathrm{H}) \\sim 0.35 - 0.5$ for type A), but is highly sensitive to wall structure and model details and thus less universal. These results offer new insights into the dynamics of FVD collapse, quantify practical PBH-formation thresholds, and pave the way for precise predictions of PBH abundance from delayed FOPTs."}

For CubeCarve source code, see https://github.com/kevhall23/CubeCarve", "summary": "We present a study of extended Ly$α$ emission around four quasars hosted by dusty starbursts, which are composite systems thought to represent a transitional stage in quasar evolution. To extract faint CGM emission in the presence of bright point sources, we introduce {\\it CubeCarve}, a dual-channel deconvolution algorithm that separates unresolved quasar emission from spatially extended structure. This approach enables reliable recovery of \\Lya\\ emission projected onto the quasar position without introducing subtraction artifacts. Using {\\it CubeCarve}, we find that the \\Lya\\ surface brightness profiles of these systems are, on average, fainter and shallower than those of quasars of similar bolometric luminosities. We also find that the total integrated \\Lya\\ luminosities of the nebulae are lower in systems whose host galaxies exhibit brighter far-infrared emission. These results suggest that the CGM conditions in composite systems differ from those in the broader quasar population. Our study highlights both the physical diversity of quasar CGM environments and the effectiveness of {\\it CubeCarve} for recovering diffuse emission in modern IFU datasets."}

Both the direct part and the tail are contributed by branch cut integrals on the complex-frequency domain, and the quasinormal modes correspond to poles of the Green's function. We show that these different components match the Green's function numerically obtained by solving a time-domain Regge-Wheeler code. In addition, the components of the Green's function also agree with earlier studies in Schwarzschild spacetime with small cosmological constant. The identification of all the various parts of the Schwarzschild Green's function represents an important step towards analyzing direct waves and quasinormal modes in the ringdown stage of binary black hole coalescence, as well as their nonlinear interaction near the merger."}

Identifying such lensed pairs, however, remains challenging due to the computational cost and/or the reliance on prior knowledge of source parameters in existing methods. This study investigates a novel approach, Optimal Cross-Correlation Analysis for Multiplets (OCCAM), applied to strain data from one or more detectors for Compact Binary Coalescence (CBC) events identified by GW searches, using an optimal, mildly model-dependent, low computation cost approach to identify strongly lensed candidates. This technique efficiently narrows the search space, allowing for more sensitive, but (much) higher latency, algorithms to refine the results further. We demonstrate that our method performs significantly better than other computationally inexpensive methods. In particular, we achieve 97 percent (80 percent) lensed event detection at a pairwise false positive probability of approximately 13 percent (7 percent) for a single detector with LIGO design sensitivity, assuming an SNR greater than or equal to 10 astrophysically motivated lensed and unlensed populations. Thus, this method, using a network of detectors and in conjunction with sky-localisation information, can enormously reduce the false positive probability, making it highly viable to efficiently and quickly search for lensing pairs among thousands of events, including the sub-threshold candidates."}

While the microphysical details may differ, as long as these sources are bounded in duration and correlation length, their tensor power spectra exhibit a universal scaling behavior at small wavenumber: $P_h(k) \\propto k^3$, corresponding to white noise on super-horizon scales at the time of production. If these early causal tensor sources (ECTs) exclusively produce gravitational waves before redshift $z \\sim 10^5$, this scaling is realized on all of the scales observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and thus yields a universal multipole distribution for the $B$-mode angular power spectrum. Unlike the scale-invariant distributions of inflationary $B$ modes, ECTs generically predict enhanced power on small scales and suppressed power on large scales, which allows these source classes to be distinguished given measurements over a sufficient range of angular scales. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for characterizing ECTs and demonstrate how their universal infrared scaling manifests in low-frequency observables, including CMB $B$ modes and stochastic gravitational wave spectral densities. We illustrate this mapping with representative case studies of this universality class involving first-order phase transitions, topological defects, and enhanced scalar perturbations, which source tensor modes at second order in perturbation theory."}

This particular form of EoS was first proposed by S. Saha and K. Bamba in 2019 and has two parameters, $θ_1$ and $θ_2$, which must be determined from observations. To this end, we place limits on these parameters by combining recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data -- including measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) -- with Type Ia supernova observations from the Pantheon+ compilation, along with direct determinations of the Hubble parameter. From this combined analysis, we obtain a best-fit value for the Hubble parameter, $H_0 = 67.4 \\pm 1.2~\\text{km\\,s}^{-1}\\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, while current measurements of the sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch yield $r_d = 146\\pm 2.5$~Mpc. Furthermore, we study the evolution of the deceleration parameter, the effective EoS, and the jerk parameter, and support our findings using the $Om(z)$ diagnostic. The model exhibits noticeable deviations from the predictions of the concordance $Λ$CDM model. Despite these differences, our results indicate that the model provides a coherent description of late-time cosmic evolution and the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe. Finally, we assess the observational viability of the model using information criteria, particularly the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and compare these results with those obtained for the $Λ$CDM model, which serves as our reference."}

In such scenarios, however, a phantom-divide crossing, as recently suggested by DESI observations, is not achieved without encountering theoretical inconsistencies. We incorporate a canonical scalar field with a potential, in addition to the vector field, and show that the phantom-divide crossing from $w_{\\rm DE} < -1$ to $w_{\\rm DE} > -1$ can occur at low redshifts. We propose a minimal model that admits such a transition and identify the region of parameter space in which all dynamical degrees of freedom in the scalar, vector, and tensor sectors are free from ghost and Laplacian instabilities. We further investigate the evolution of linear cosmological perturbations by applying the quasi-static approximation to modes well inside the Hubble radius. The dimensionless quantities $μ$ and $Σ$, which characterize the growth of matter perturbations and the bending of light rays, respectively, depend on the sound speed $c_ψ$ of the longitudinal scalar perturbation associated with the vector field. Since $c_ψ$ is influenced by the transverse vector mode, the model exhibits sufficient flexibility to yield values of $μ$ and $Σ$ close to 1. Consequently, unlike theories such as scalar Galileons, the present model can be consistent with observations of redshift-space distortions and integrated Sachs-Wolfe-galaxy cross-correlations."}

Gaia DR3 provides precise measurements of the four sky-plane components of the 3D relative displacement and velocity ($\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{v}$) for a wide binary, but not comparably precise line-of-sight (radial) separation and relative velocity $v_{r}$. Based on our new observations and the public databases/publications, we assemble a sample of 36 nearby (distance $<150$pc) wide binaries in the low-acceleration regime with accurate values of $v_{r}$ (uncertainty $< 100$ m\\,s$^{-1}$). Kinematic contaminants such as undetected stellar companions are well under control using various observational diagnostics such as Gaia's ruwe parameter, the color-magnitude diagram, multi-epoch observations of radial velocities, Speckle interferometric follow-up observations, and requiring Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion consistency.

The hypothesis that Newtonian gravity can be extrapolated to the low-acceleration limit is falsified by this independent study with accurate 3D velocities. Future radial velocity monitoring and Speckle interferometric imaging for larger samples will be useful to refine the present result."}

In this Letter we propose a new, purely geometric null test of the late-time expansion history that is exactly independent of the Hubble constant. By combining strong-lensing time-delay distances with gravitational-wave standard-siren luminosity distances, we construct a dimensionless ratio that depends only on the redshift dependence of the expansion rate and can be both predicted from early-Universe data and measured directly at late times, without relying on the cosmic distance ladder or the sound horizon. We show that the comparison between the early- and late-time determinations of this ratio provides a transparent consistency test of the standard cosmological expansion. When combined with an independent standard-siren measurement of $H_{0}$, this framework allows one to unambiguously distinguish between early- and late-time origins of the Hubble tension. With the forthcoming detection of lensed gravitational-wave standard sirens, the proposed test provides a timely and robust framework for probing this long-standing cosmological puzzle."}

We demonstrate that a lunar-based laser interferometer, such as the proposed Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA), can directly probe the sound speed of dark energy by measuring the real-time evolution of horizon-scale gravitational potentials. Operating in the ultra-low-frequency gravitational band inaccessible from Earth, LILA is sensitive to scalar metric perturbations sourced by dark energy dynamics. Using both fluid and effective field theory descriptions, we develop a complete framework linking dark energy sound speed to observable strain signatures. We construct a likelihood pipeline and Fisher forecasts, showing that LILA can either detect clustering dark energy or exclude broad classes of models with unprecedented sensitivity. This establishes lunar interferometry as a novel and powerful probe of the physics driving cosmic acceleration."}
