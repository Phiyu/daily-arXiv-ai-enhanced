We then analyze the binary-disc interaction using a 3D\nanalytical framework incorporating the Airy formalism and potential softening.\nWe present a self-consistent derivation demonstrating that the 3D suppression\nof high-order torques leads to distinct scalings with disc thickness ($h$):\nmigration rates $\\tau_a^{-1} \\propto h^{-3}$ and eccentricity damping rates\n$\\tau_e^{-1} \\propto h^{-5}$.

We derive the stochastic torque variance in the wavelet domain and\nemploy a Fokker-Planck analysis to determine the equilibrium eccentricity\ndistribution. While stochastic fluctuations counteract deterministic damping,\nthe strong damping imposed by the thick disc geometry ensures the equilibrium\neccentricity remains small unless the fluctuations are highly non-linear.\nHence, even if born highly eccentric, SMBHBs are rapidly circularized. This\ncircularization trap forces binaries to approach the gravitational\nwave-dominated regime on nearly circular orbits, prolonging the total merger\ntimescale.

This correlation\nis quantified by the ratio Rp/p, which has been measured to be 5.42 +/- 0.05\nMJy sr^-1 at 353 GHz when averaged over large areas of the sky. We investigate\nthis correlation using newly published stellar polarimetric data densely\nsampling a continuous sky region of ~4 square degrees at intermediate Galactic\nlatitude. We combine RoboPol optical polarization measurements for 1,430 stars\nwith submillimeter data from the Planck satellite at 353 GHz. We perform linear\nfits between the Planck (Qs, Us) and optical (qv, uv) Stokes parameters,\naccounting for the differences in resolution between the two datasets as well\nas the distribution of clouds along the line of sight. We find that in this\nregion of the sky the Rp/p value is 3.67 +/- 0.05 MJy sr^-1, indicating a\nsignificantly shallower slope than that found previously using different\nstellar samples. We also find significant differences in the fitted slopes when\nfitting the Qs-qv and Us-uv data separately. We explore two explanations using\nmock data: miscalibration of polarization angle and variations in Rp/p along\nthe line of sight due to multiple clouds. We show that the former can produce\ndifferences in the correlations of Qs-qv and Us-uv, but large miscalibration\nangles would be needed to reproduce the magnitude of the observed differences.\nOur simulations favor the interpretation that Rp/p differs between the two\ndominant clouds that overlap on the sky in this region. The difference in Rp/p\nsuggests that the two clouds may have distinct dust polarimetric properties.\nWith knowledge from the tomographic decomposition of the stellar polarization,\nwe find that one cloud appears to dominate the correlation of Us-uv, while both\nclouds contribute to the correlation of the Qs-qv data."}

Abstract abridged", "summary": "We investigate the orbital eccentricity evolution of supermassive black hole\nbinaries within galactic environments. We analyze the dynamics in triaxial\nmerger remnants and subsequent interactions with geometrically thick nuclear\ndiscs. We confirm that gravitational torques in triaxial potentials efficiently\nextract angular momentum, resulting in binary formation with high initial\neccentricities. We then analyze the binary-disc interaction using a 3D\nanalytical framework incorporating the Airy formalism and potential softening.\nWe present a self-consistent derivation demonstrating that the 3D suppression\nof high-order torques leads to distinct scalings with disc thickness ($h$):\nmigration rates $\\tau_a^{-1} \\propto h^{-3}$ and eccentricity damping rates\n$\\tau_e^{-1} \\propto h^{-5}$. This establishes a timescale hierarchy,\n$\\tau_e/\\tau_a \\propto h^2$. For typical parameters ($h\\approx 0.2$),\neccentricity damping is significantly faster than orbital decay ($\\tau_e\n\\approx 0.04 \\, \\tau_a$). We further develop a wavelet-based formalism to\nquantify the impact of disc inhomogeneities arising from accretion feedback and\nturbulence. We derive the stochastic torque variance in the wavelet domain and\nemploy a Fokker-Planck analysis to determine the equilibrium eccentricity\ndistribution. While stochastic fluctuations counteract deterministic damping,\nthe strong damping imposed by the thick disc geometry ensures the equilibrium\neccentricity remains small unless the fluctuations are highly non-linear.\nHence, even if born highly eccentric, SMBHBs are rapidly circularized. This\ncircularization trap forces binaries to approach the gravitational\nwave-dominated regime on nearly circular orbits, prolonging the total merger\ntimescale. This introduces a substantial cosmological delay governed by stellar\nrelaxation, which impacts detection rates and the modeling of SMBH assembly in\ncosmological frameworks."}
