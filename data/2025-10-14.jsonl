The catalog will be\n  made publicly available after the paper is accepted. Comments welcome!", "summary": "Dynamically cold stellar streams from tidally dissolved globular clusters\n(GCs) serve as excellent tools to measure the Galactic mass distribution and\nshow promise to probe the nature of dark matter. For successful application of\nthese tools to observations, it is essential to have an accurate model of\nstellar stream properties on the Galactic scale. To this end we produce a mock\ncatalog of stellar streams in four simulated Milky Way-like galaxies. We build\nthe catalog with three main components: a model for the formation and\ndisruption of globular clusters based on cosmological simulations,\ntime-dependent potentials constructed with basis function expansions for\nintegrating stream orbits, and an improved particle spray algorithm for\nefficient generation of stellar streams. We find that the observable widths and\nlengths of mock streams as a function of galactocentric radius are well\ndescribed by power-laws for streams beyond 10 kpc. We generate mock photometry\nfor Gaia, LSST, and Roman, and find that the latter two surveys will increase\nthe number of observable stars in GC stellar streams by several orders of\nmagnitude. Our full catalog, containing stream populations across four\ndifferent galaxy realizations, is publicly available and can be used to study\nstream population statistics and to calibrate models which use stellar streams\nto understand our Galaxy."}
