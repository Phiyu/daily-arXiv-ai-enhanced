Gas accretion onto stellar black hole clusters in galactic central molecular zones", "comment": "To be published in Astronomy & Astrophysics; 6 pages, 2 figures", "summary": "The stellar dynamical evolution of massive star clusters formed during starburst periods leads to the segregation of $\\gtrsim10^4 M_\\odot$ stellar-mass black hole sub-clusters in their centres. In gas-rich environments, such as galactic central molecular zones, these black hole clusters are likely to accrete large amounts of the gas from their surroundings, which in turn affects their internal dynamics. In this Letter we estimated the corresponding accretion rate onto the black hole cluster and its radiative feedback. We assessed whether such an accretion flow can lead to the collapse of the black hole cluster into an intermediate-mass black hole. The estimates were obtained analytically, considering the astrophysical conditions and star formation history reported for the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. We find that a stellar black hole cluster with mass $\\gtrsim10^4 M_\\odot$ located in the twisted ring of molecular clouds with radius $\\approx100$ pc that is observed in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy can accrete about the same mass in gas on a timescale of a few million years. We suggest that this is sufficient for its subsequent collapse into an intermediate-mass black hole. Based on an estimate of the dynamical friction inspiral time, we further argue that the locations of the intermediate-mass black hole candidates recently observed in the central molecular zone are compatible with their formation therein during the last starburst period reported to have occurred $\\approx1$ Gyr ago."}

In this work, we present the first systematic search for molecules in the Milky Way wind. We use the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) to observe the 12CO(2-1) emission line in 19 fields centered on previously known high-velocity atomic hydrogen (HI) clouds associated with the outflow. Over 200 CO clumps are detected within 16 different HI clouds. These clumps have typical radii of 1 - 3 parsec, high velocity dispersions of 1 - 6 km/s and molecular gas masses ranging from a few to several hundred solar masses. Molecular clumps in the wind sit on the low-mass end of the mass - size relation of regular molecular clouds, but are far displaced from the mass (or size) - linewidth relation, being generally more turbulent and showing high internal pressures. Nearly 90% of the clumps are gravitationally unbound with virial parameters >> 10 - 100, indicating that these structures are either being disrupted or they must be confined by external pressure from the surrounding hot medium. While the observed properties of CO clumps do not seem to evolve clearly with latitude, we find that molecular gas is not detected in any of the 6 HI clouds with projected distances over 1 kpc from the Galactic Center, suggesting the existence of a maximum timescale of ~ 3 Myr for the dissociation of molecular gas within the wind. Overall, current observations in the Galactic center support a scenario in which a hot wind entrains cold gas clouds from the disk, driving their progressive transformation from molecular to atomic and ultimately ionized gas through stripping, turbulence, and dissociation."}

Starting from a universally conformally coupled matter sector, we rewrite the field equations in terms of the invariant set $\\{{\\cal I}_1,{\\cal I}_2,{\\cal I}_3,\\hat g_{μν}\\}$, so that Machian requirements can be stated independently of conformal frame. Sciama's causal postulate is implemented not by modifying the local dynamics, but as a selection rule on the solution space of the invariant scalar equation: the admissible configuration is the retarded response to the matter distribution in the causal past, with any source-free contribution removed. In a spatially flat FLRW universe, and in the light, slowly varying regime, the prescription reduces to an explicit temporal kernel that links the background scalar evolution to the matter content within the Hubble region, reproducing the expected Machian scaling in an expanding background. Universal coupling to a single physical metric implies that structureless test bodies share the same acceleration in a given external configuration, so that the Eötvs parameter vanishes at leading order. Nonuniversal effects can arise only when gravitational binding energy contributes appreciably to the total mass, as in strongly self-gravitating objects. Thus, the theory implements a causal Machian determination of the cosmological inertial scale while remaining consistent with standard weak-field tests."}

We present a self-consistent linear-perturbation analysis taking into account pressure and density gradients in the background medium. We explore two different steady-state configurations for the unperturbed gas: hydrostatic equilibrium and infall into a gravitational potential well. We show that in both cases the instability criterion is the classical Jeans criterion, which, contrary to previous claims, is not modified by the presence of the external gravitational field. While in the case of hydrostatic equilibrium linear local perturbations are always gravitationally stable, the conditions for gravitational instability can be met in the case of infalling gas, also in the presence of additional non-gravitational forces such as that due to a wind. We conclude that the Jeans criterion can have a role in regulating the formation of clumps and star clusters in streams or shells of gas infalling into galactic gravitational potential wells, as well as, on smaller scales, the fragmentation of gas in collapsing molecular clouds."}

Combining strong and weak lensing data for massive clusters, we map their total mass--dominated by dark matter--over the dynamic range needed to confront small-scale predictions for collisionless cold dark matter (CDM). Using state-of-the-art lens models, we extract four key subhalo properties: the mass function, projected radial distribution, internal density profile, and tidal truncation radius. We find that the subhalo mass function and truncation radii are consistent with CDM expectations. In contrast, the inner density profiles and radial distribution of subhalos are strongly discrepant with CDM. The incidence of galaxy-galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) from subhalo cores exceeds CDM predictions by nearly an order of magnitude, requiring inner density slopes as steep as $γ\\gtrsim 2.5$ within $r \\lesssim 0.01\\,R_{200}$ consistent with core-collapsed self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), while the same subhalos behave as collisionless in their outskirts.

Together, these small-scale stress tests reveal an intriguing paradox and challenge the dark matter microphysics of purely collisionless CDM and motivate hybrid scenarios, such as a dual-component model with both CDM and SIDM, or entirely new classes of dark matter theories."}

Cosmic voids are underdense regions of the Universe that provide a unique environment to study galaxy evolution in relative isolation. Galaxy triplets in voids are rare systems where local interactions may strongly influence galaxy properties.\n  Aims. We study the stellar populations, morphologies, mass assembly histories, and dynamical properties of six galaxies belonging to two void triplets from the Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY (CAVITY): CAVITY5273X and VGS31.\n  Methods. We used integral-field unit spectroscopy and performed full spectral fitting with the FADO code, which models stellar and nebular emission simultaneously. Spatially resolved maps of stellar age, metallicity, and star formation rate were reconstructed using the integrated nested Laplace approximation. Morphological properties were derived using morfometryka, emission-line diagnostics were applied, and mass assembly functions were computed. Stellar masses and metallicities were compared to the mass-metallicity relation for void galaxies.\n  Results. The two triplets show different evolutionary behaviours. CAVITY52731 is a massive quenched galaxy hosting an active galactic nucleus, while its companions and all galaxies in VGS31 are dominated by young stellar populations and recent star formation. Five galaxies experienced rapid stellar mass growth in the last 2 Gyr. Disturbed morphologies, including asymmetries and tidal features, indicate ongoing interactions. Galaxies in CAVITY5273X follow the expected void mass-metallicity relation, while VGS31 members show significant deviations.\n  Conclusions.

We find that, compared to higher-luminosity AGN, these low-luminosity AGN exhibit distinct properties in their emission of ionized gas, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and molecular hydrogen (H$_2$). Specifically, the low-luminosity AGN exhibit relatively weak high-ionization potential lines (e.g., [Ne V] and [O IV]), and the line ratios suggest that fast radiative shocks (with $v_{\\rm s}$ of $\\sim \\rm 100s\\,km\\,s^{-1}$) are the primary excitation source of ionized gas therein. Under the low-excitation conditions of their nuclear regions, these low-luminosity AGN generally exhibit a higher fraction of PAHs with large size ($N_{\\rm C} \\gtrsim 200$), reflecting the preferential destruction of smaller PAH molecules by AGN feedback. Furthermore, the H$_2$ transitions in these low-luminosity AGN are not fully thermalized, with slow, plausibly jet-driven molecular shocks (with $v_{\\rm s} \\leq \\rm 10\\,km\\,s^{-1}$) likely being the extra excitation source. Taken together with results from the literature, these findings indicate that feedback operates in both low- and high-luminosity AGN, albeit its impact varies with AGN luminosity. In particular, systematic variations in PAH band ratios are found across AGN, demonstrating the differing influence of feedback in AGN of varying luminosities and highlighting the potential of PAH band ratios as diagnostics for distinguishing kinetic- and radiative-mode AGN feedback."}

However, the mechanisms driving their quenching remain elusive. We conduct a multi-wavelength analysis of 155 RQEs, along with their precursors (preRQEs) and descendants (postRQEs), focusing on their neutral hydrogen (HI) content and star formation properties. Contrary to conventional quenching models emphasizing gas depletion, RQEs retain substantial HI reservoirs ($f_{\\text{gas}} \\geq 17\\%$), suggesting that quenching is not primarily driven by gas exhaustion. We identify a critical halo mass threshold at $\\log M_{\\text{halo}} = 12.1 M_{\\odot}$, delineating different evolutionary pathways for RQEs. This threshold aligns with the transition from cold-mode to hot-mode gas accretion in theoretical models. RQEs in lower-mass halos ($\\log M_{\\text{halo}} < 12.1 M_{\\odot}$) likely experience rapid quenching, possibly initiated by major mergers, followed by brief AGN activity and sustained LINER emission. We propose two evolutionary pathways: (a) rapid quenching via major mergers followed by AGN/LINER activity and passive evolution, and (b) rapid quenching followed by rejuvenation through minor mergers before evolving into more massive, long-term quenched ellipticals. These results challenge the conventional understanding of galaxy quenching, especially in low-density environments where RQEs typically reside. Our findings suggest that while RQEs may follow a rapid quenching pathway, their evolution is influenced by interactions between gas accretion modes, feedback mechanisms, and environmental factors. Future observations with advanced radio interferometers like SKA will be crucial for elucidating the quenching mechanisms in RQEs and their role in galaxy evolution."}

Extending our previous work, where multistate SFDM solutions were shown to form ``gravitational atoms'' capable of explaining the anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies (VPOS), we analyze here the coupled dynamics of the scalar and a gauge field at the perturbative level. By solving the perturbed Klein-Gordon and gauge-field equations, we find the temporal evolution and show that the spatial structure of the induced electromagnetic fields is governed by the same spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics that characterize the ground and excited states of the multi-state SFDM halo. Remarkably, the presence of the gauge field does not modify the dark-matter density distribution, which preserves the multi-state configuration previously obtained. Our results demonstrate that a charged multi-state SFDM halo can generate coherent, large-scale magnetic fields whose morphology is determined by the excited modes of the scalar field, providing a unified framework in which both galactic magnetic fields and VPOS-like structures originate from the underlying quantum nature of dark matter."}

Depending on selection method, observing wavelength, and brightness, AGNs are assigned distinct labels, yet the relationship between different selection methods and the diversity of time-domain behavior within and across classes remains difficult to characterize in a unified framework. Changing-look AGNs (CLAGNs), which transition between classifications over time, further complicate this picture. In this work, we learn a data-driven, low-dimensional representation of multi-wavelength photometric light curves of AGNs, in which the structure of the projected manifold correlates with AGN class and independent spectroscopic properties. Using the NASA Fornax Science Platform, we assemble light curves from ZTF, Pan-STARRS, Gaia, and WISE/NEOWISE for two samples: (1) a heterogeneous set of $\\sim$2000 AGNs spanning $z \\lesssim 1$, including SDSS quasars, variability-selected sources, and CLAGNs; and (2) a homogeneous sample of $\\sim$65000 narrow-line AGNs at $z \\approx 0.1$ with well-characterized optical emission-line measurements. Without using class labels during training, the learned manifolds organize variability-selected AGNs into coherent regions of the low-dimensional space, distinguish between turn-on and turn-off CLAGNs, and place tidal disruption events in distinct regions. Manifold coordinates correlate with key spectroscopic and host-galaxy properties, including stellar mass, [OIII] luminosity, and D$_n$(4000), demonstrating that heterogeneous multi-band variability can be combined in a purely data-driven manner to recover correlations with independent physical diagnostics, without requiring explicit physical modeling. These results show that manifold learning offers a practical, assumption-light approach for integrating time-domain surveys and prioritizing spectroscopic follow-up."}

We study their behavior near the event horizon and the classical singularity, with particular attention to the interpretation of the wave function in terms of the annihilation-to-nothing scenario proposed in general relativity. In this paper, we have considered cases in which the two-dimensional spatial section is spherical, planar, or hyperbolic, as well as models with positive, negative, or vanishing cosmological constant. In all cases, we find that the terms dominating in the ultraviolet regime, together with the effects of the running scaling parameter, act to suppress the annihilation-to-nothing behavior.

To be submitted to OJA", "summary": "We revisit the Great Attractor using the Manticore-Local suite of digital twins of the nearby Universe. The Great Attractor concept has been proposed as an answer to three distinct questions: what sources the Local Group velocity in the cosmic microwave background frame, where present-day velocity streamlines converge, and where the Local Group is moving to. Addressing the original motivation of the Great Attractor -- explaining the Local Group cosmic velocity -- we find that mass within $155~h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$ accounts for only ${\\sim}72\\%$ of that velocity magnitude with ${\\sim}38\\,°$ directional offset. We show that even in the purely linear regime convergence within this volume is not guaranteed, particularly when also accounting for small-scale contributions to the observer velocity; no single structure, including the proposed Great Attractor, would be expected to dominate the velocity budget. Streamline convergence is smoothing-scale-dependent, transitioning from Virgo at small scales through the Hydra--Centaurus region at intermediate scales to Shapley at large scales; at intermediate smoothing the convergence point lies near Abell 3565 with an asymmetric basin of mass $\\log( M / (h^{-1} \\mathrm{M}_\\odot)) = 16.4 \\pm 0.1$ that excludes Norma. To address the third question, we evolve the Manticore-Local realisations to scale factor $a = 10$ in a new Beyond-Present-Time simulation suite and identify the asymptotic future location of the Local Group. We find that the dominant motion is towards Virgo, but even it contributes at most one third of the Local Group velocity. Our results demonstrate that the classical Great Attractor is not a dynamically dominant structure but an artifact of the instantaneous velocity field, and that no single attractor is likely to account for the Local Group motion in the cosmic rest frame."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "Type Ia supernovae, type II supernovae, and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are important sites of stellar nucleosynthesis, but they differ greatly in their rates, their location within a galaxy, and the mean thermal energy and abundance distribution of their ejecta. In earlier papers in this series we have shown that a significant fraction of metals newly synthesized by type II supernovae are promptly lost to galactic winds -- i.e., galactic winds are metal loaded. Here we investigate whether the elements returned by type Ia supernovae and AGB stars are similarly metal loaded, or whether metal loading varies significantly with nucleosynthetic site. We use a series of high-resolution ``tall box'' simulations of the interstellar medium with the \\quokka~GPU-accelerated code, within which we systematically vary the galaxy gas surface density, metallicity, and the scale heights and relative rates of the different nucleosynthetic sources. We show that the metal loadings of galactic winds differ substantially between metals produced by different sources, with typical variations at the level of $\\approx 0.3$ dex, a phenomenon we term differential metal loading. Which set of metals suffers preferential loss from this phenomenon varies depending on the galactic environment, and is not easily predictable \\textit{a priori}. Our findings call into question the the interpretation of diagnostics of galaxy formation, for example star formation timescales and initial mass functions, based on abundance diagnostics, since the abundance variations upon which these techniques rely are often at levels comparable to those we show can be induced by differential metal loading."}

OJ287 is a bright, nearby ($z=0.3$), and well-studied candidate for a SMBH binary. As such, it is an excellent case study for how binary dynamics could influence observed active galactic nucleus (AGN) photometric variability.

The secondary's impacts with the disc result in the formation of spiral density waves and a corresponding $\\sim$10-20% increases in the mass accretion rate of the primary SMBH. The impact timings and the mass accretion rate spikes show quasi-periodic variability as a result of the precession of the secondary's orbit with intervals between impacts ranging from $\\sim$ 1 year to $\\sim$ 10 years. In the near-equal mass case, the disc of the primary becomes tidally disrupted after $\\sim$ 2 years. Consequently, the near-equal mass system with a period of 12 years is not a viable candidate for OJ287. This modeling provides insights into the potential signatures of SMBH binaries by both gravitational wave observatories and the Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time."}

We were further able to classify these X-ray sources based on their optical variability and any radio emission. Three IC 2602 X-ray sources had radio counterparts, which are likely all chromospherically active binary stars. We also identified luminous radio and X-ray variability from a spectroscopic triple system in M67, WOCS 3012/S1077, which is either consistent with a quiescent black hole binary, or due to an active binary stellar system.

Motivated by the need for more realistic analytical black hole models, our construction incorporates two key ingredients often neglected in exact solutions: a fully dynamical cosmological background and the non-perturbative backreaction of external electromagnetic fields. The compact object is obtained by dressing a Schwarzschild black hole with a radially and temporally dependent scalar field, yielding a time-dependent generalization of the Fisher-Janis-Newman-Winicour solution within the Fonarev framework. The external electromagnetic field is generated via a Lie point symmetry of the Einstein-scalar-Maxwell system, which exports the effect of a Harrison transformation to dynamical settings provided a spacelike Killing vector is present. The resulting spacetime combines a spherically symmetric dynamical horizon with an axisymmetric electromagnetic field and exhibits a rich asymptotic structure mixing Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker and Levi-Civita geometries. We show that the time dependence of the configuration plays a crucial role in potentially cloaking curvature singularities, which would otherwise be generically naked in the stationary limit.

We also detect a sharp surface brightness edge at $\\sim$72 kpc south-east of the centre, characterised by a temperature jump and pressure continuity, consistent with a cold front, likely caused by gas sloshing from a minor merger. Our uGMRT images reveals an interesting diffuse emission surrounding the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), with its edge spatially coinciding with the sloshing cold front and roughly with the cooling radius. Furthermore, a low star formation rate and uniform metal abundance up to the sloshing edge are consistent with the earlier findings of suppression of star formation and metallicity homogenisation by mixing core gas through sloshing. Finally, the spatial correlation between the mini-halo and the observed X-ray features indicates that ICM sloshing, rather than AGN feedback, plays a dominant role in powering the proposed radio mini-halo emission."}

However, we recently found several heavily-obscured ($A_V > 50$ mag) AGNs with broad H$α$ detections: MCG -3-34-64, UGC 5101, and Mrk 268. To investigate the origin of the observed broad line in these AGNs, we performed multi-epoch optical spectroscopic observations to search for flux variability of the broad H$α$ line. For MCG -3-34-64 and UGC 5101, no significant variability was detected, suggesting that the broad line of these AGNs may arise from sources other than the BLR. Spectral fitting analysis suggests possible large contribution of ionized outflows to the observed broad component of MCG -3-34-64, while both the outflow and scattering by polar material can explain that of UGC 5101. For Mrk 268, we detected a significant ($4.3σ$) flux variation of the broad H$α$ line by using the flux ratio of the H$α$ complex and the [SII]$λ\\lambda6716$, 6731 doublet, indicating that the broad line originates directly from the BLR. The lack of significant flux variation in the optical continuum implies that the line of sight to the nucleus of Mrk 268 is mildly obscured. Our results demonstrate that the observed broad H$α$ lines in obscured AGNs likely have multiple origins. Such complexity may introduce additional uncertainties in black hole mass measurements of distant AGNs revealed by e.g., JWST."}

Using this energy and indistinguishable area quanta satisfying quantum statistics a statistical mechanical description of the Schwarzschild black hole geometry for uniformly accelerating observers is developed. The resulting model has several phases including one with highly excited states, Bose-Einstein condensates, condensates distinct from the usual Bose gas, and degenerate Fermi gases. In the large area limit, relevant for comparison to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, the new condensed state is favored over Bose-Einstein condensation and the degenerate Fermi gas. The entropies of the phases, and the entropy of mixing, are computed. The resulting low-entropic condensed state, where the quanta are essentially all in the lowest Bose energy state, provides the framework for the quantization of near-horizon geometric fluctuations, which is explored in a companion paper."}

Accepted to MNRAS", "summary": "Rotation curves are a fundamental tool in the study of galaxies across cosmic time, and with the advent of large integral field unit (IFU) kinematic surveys there is an increasing need for efficient and flexible modelling tools. We present RotCurves, a parametric forward-modeling tool designed for rotation curve analysis at high-z, correcting for ``beam smearing\" by projecting and convolving the beam PSF in the plane of the galaxy. We benchmark RotCurves against the established parametric code dysmalpy using synthetic observations. The typical runtime with RotCurves is a few ~10ms, a factor 250 faster than dysmalpy for a single realization. For well-resolved systems (PSF FWHM < Reff), the mock observed rotation and dispersion curves agree to within 5% up to 3Reff, where most of the discrepancies are in the inner disk. whereas in marginally resolved systems (PSF FWHM > 1.5 Reff) discrepancies increase to up to 15%. Using a built-in MCMC fitting procedure, RotCurves recovers well the intrinsic model parameters across a wide range of galaxy properties and accounting for realistic noise patterns. Systematic biases emerge for the effective radius and for low disk masses (Mdisk < 3x10^9 Msun). We show excellent parameter recovery at high signal-to-noise ratios (S/N > 25), with increasing deviations in parameter recovery at lower S/N. RotCurves is best suited for inclinations of 10 < i < 80. RotCurves is built as an exploratory tool for rapid testing of mass model assumptions, parameter studies and for efficiently processing large samples of observational data from large IFU surveys. The code is publicly available on github."}

The otherwise divergent energy and entropy is cutoff by the Planck scale closest approach of constantly accelerating observers near the horizon. The thermal distribution of the trapped modes, which represent shape fluctuations in the near horizon geometry, store a significant fraction of the spacetime mass as observed from far away.

Starting from a universally conformally coupled matter sector, we rewrite the field equations in terms of the invariant set $\\{{\\cal I}_1,{\\cal I}_2,{\\cal I}_3,\\hat g_{μν}\\}$, so that Machian requirements can be stated independently of conformal frame. Sciama's causal postulate is implemented not by modifying the local dynamics, but as a selection rule on the solution space of the invariant scalar equation: the admissible configuration is the retarded response to the matter distribution in the causal past, with any source-free contribution removed. In a spatially flat FLRW universe, and in the light, slowly varying regime, the prescription reduces to an explicit temporal kernel that links the background scalar evolution to the matter content within the Hubble region, reproducing the expected Machian scaling in an expanding background. Universal coupling to a single physical metric implies that structureless test bodies share the same acceleration in a given external configuration, so that the Eötvs parameter vanishes at leading order. Nonuniversal effects can arise only when gravitational binding energy contributes appreciably to the total mass, as in strongly self-gravitating objects. Thus, the theory implements a causal Machian determination of the cosmological inertial scale while remaining consistent with standard weak-field tests."}

In this paper we show that these difficulties arise from the abruptness of the truncation rather than from the finite extent itself. We introduce a general and infinitely differentiable radial truncation scheme that can be applied to any density profile, and illustrate its behaviour using the Hernquist model. We find that softly truncated models are dynamically consistent provided that the truncation is sufficiently gradual, and we determine the corresponding critical truncation sharpness. Their distribution functions display a characteristic bump-dip feature near the truncation energy that signals the transition between consistent and inconsistent cases. In contrast to sharply truncated models, softly truncated systems can support an extensive family of Osipkov-Merritt orbital structures, including moderately radial ones. Soft truncations therefore offer a general and physically motivated route to constructing finite-extent dynamical models with well-controlled outer-edge behaviour."}

The rotation curve was selected in such a way that there would be no dominant burst of circular velocities in the central ($R<2$ kpc) region of the Galaxy.

We analyse the stellar masses using different modelling assumptions and with new data of three galaxies (S1, S2 and S3), whose NIRCam/grism redshifts were consistent with $z>5$. These three optically dark galaxies have previously been reported to host exceptionally high stellar masses and star-formation rates, implying extremely high star-formation efficiencies. Recent NIRSpec/IFU observations for S1 indicate a spectroscopic redshift of $z_{\\rm spec}=3.2461^{+0.0001}_{-0.0002}$, which is lower than previously reported. Using the Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling tool \\texttt{Prospector}, we investigate the impact of key model assumptions on stellar mass estimates, such as the choice of star-formation history (SFH) priors (constant versus rising SFH base for the non-parametric prior), the dust attenuation law, and the treatment of emission line fluxes. Our analysis yields revised stellar masses of $\\log(M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot}) \\approx 10.36^{+0.47}_{-0.32}, 10.95^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ and $10.31^{+0.24}_{-0.19}$ for S1, S2, and S3, respectively. We find that adopting a rising SFH base prior results in lower inferred stellar masses compared to a constant SFH base prior. We identify a significant degeneracy between the dust attenuation curve slope, the amount of dust attenuation, and stellar mass. Our results highlight various systematics in SED modelling due to SFH priors and dust attenuation that can influence stellar mass estimates of heavily dust obscured sources. Nevertheless, even with these revised stellar mass estimates, two of the three galaxies remain among the most massive and actively star-forming systems at their respective redshifts, implying high star-formation efficiencies."}

Accepted for publication in A&A Letters", "summary": "We present new precise measurements of electron temperatures and oxygen abundances in the southeast knot of I Zw 18, one of the most metal-poor blue compact dwarf galaxies known, using spectroscopic data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI DR1). For the first time in I Zw 18, we directly measure electron temperature in the low-ionization zone using the rarely detected [O II] $λ\\lambda7320,7330$ doublet. We also detect the auroral lines [O III] $\\lambda4363$ and [S III] $\\lambda6312$, associated with high and intermediate ionization zones, respectively. We derive $T_{\\mathrm{e}}([\\mathrm{O}\\,\\mathrm{III}])=21\\,200\\pm860\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $T_{\\mathrm{e}}([\\mathrm{O}\\,\\mathrm{II}])=16\\,170\\pm950\\ \\mathrm{K}$, and $T_{\\mathrm{e}}([\\mathrm{S}\\,\\mathrm{III}])=17\\,290\\pm1750\\ \\mathrm{K}$, highlighting a significant temperature difference between ionization zones. Using these direct temperature measurements, we determine a total oxygen abundance of $12+\\log(\\mathrm{O}/\\mathrm{H})=7.066\\pm0.046$, $\\log(\\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{O})=-1.509\\pm0.097$, and $\\log(\\mathrm{S}/\\mathrm{O})=-1.558\\pm0.041$. Our results extend the calibration of $t_2$--$t_3$ relations to the highest temperatures, providing important anchor points for the temperature structure of extremely metal-poor H II regions, including high-redshift galaxies where direct temperature measurements are especially challenging."}

However, the energetics and timescales of these feedback processes are poorly constrained. We combine optical, infrared, sub-millimeter and radio observations of the active galaxy VV 340a, hosting a low-power jet launched from a supermassive black hole at its center. We find that the jet undergoes precession, with a period of (8.2 $\\pm~$5.5) $\\times~$10$^5$ years, and drives an outflow of gas at a rate of 19.4 $\\pm~$7.9 solar masses per year. The jet shocks the gas, producing highly ionized plasma extending several kiloparsecs from the nucleus. The outflow ejects sufficient gas from the galaxy to influence its star formation rate."}

Combining strong and weak lensing data for massive clusters, we map their total mass--dominated by dark matter--over the dynamic range needed to confront small-scale predictions for collisionless cold dark matter (CDM). Using state-of-the-art lens models, we extract four key subhalo properties: the mass function, projected radial distribution, internal density profile, and tidal truncation radius. We find that the subhalo mass function and truncation radii are consistent with CDM expectations. In contrast, the inner density profiles and radial distribution of subhalos are strongly discrepant with CDM. The incidence of galaxy-galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) from subhalo cores exceeds CDM predictions by nearly an order of magnitude, requiring inner density slopes as steep as $γ\\gtrsim 2.5$ within $r \\lesssim 0.01\\,R_{200}$ consistent with core-collapsed self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), while the same subhalos behave as collisionless in their outskirts. Additionally, the observed radial distribution of subhalos hosting bright cluster member galaxies, explicitly modeled in the lens reconstructions, remains incompatible with CDM. Together, these small-scale stress tests reveal an intriguing paradox and challenge the dark matter microphysics of purely collisionless CDM and motivate hybrid scenarios, such as a dual-component model with both CDM and SIDM, or entirely new classes of dark matter theories."}

To be submitted to OJA", "summary": "We revisit the Great Attractor using the Manticore-Local suite of digital twins of the nearby Universe. The Great Attractor concept has been proposed as an answer to three distinct questions: what sources the Local Group velocity in the cosmic microwave background frame, where present-day velocity streamlines converge, and where the Local Group is moving to. Addressing the original motivation of the Great Attractor -- explaining the Local Group cosmic velocity -- we find that mass within $155~h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$ accounts for only ${\\sim}72\\%$ of that velocity magnitude with ${\\sim}38\\,°$ directional offset. We show that even in the purely linear regime convergence within this volume is not guaranteed, particularly when also accounting for small-scale contributions to the observer velocity; no single structure, including the proposed Great Attractor, would be expected to dominate the velocity budget. Streamline convergence is smoothing-scale-dependent, transitioning from Virgo at small scales through the Hydra--Centaurus region at intermediate scales to Shapley at large scales; at intermediate smoothing the convergence point lies near Abell 3565 with an asymmetric basin of mass $\\log( M / (h^{-1} \\mathrm{M}_\\odot)) = 16.4 \\pm 0.1$ that excludes Norma. To address the third question, we evolve the Manticore-Local realisations to scale factor $a = 10$ in a new Beyond-Present-Time simulation suite and identify the asymptotic future location of the Local Group. We find that the dominant motion is towards Virgo, but even it contributes at most one third of the Local Group velocity. Our results demonstrate that the classical Great Attractor is not a dynamically dominant structure but an artifact of the instantaneous velocity field, and that no single attractor is likely to account for the Local Group motion in the cosmic rest frame."}

Understanding the connection between thermal X-ray and non-thermal radio emission is key to uncovering their origin. Here, we present a multiwavelength study of the cool-core cluster RXCJ1558.3-1410 using archival Chandra X-ray and wideband uGMRT radio data (Bands 3, 4 and 5). Our improved analysis confirms a previously known X-ray cavity at $\\sim$36 kpc south-east of the cluster centre and we report a new cavity at $\\sim$42 kpc to the north-west. These cavities suggest that the AGN provides mechanical power of $\\sim$$6.0 \\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, sufficient to offset radiative cooling in the ICM. We also detect a sharp surface brightness edge at $\\sim$72 kpc south-east of the centre, characterised by a temperature jump and pressure continuity, consistent with a cold front, likely caused by gas sloshing from a minor merger. Our uGMRT images reveals an interesting diffuse emission surrounding the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), with its edge spatially coinciding with the sloshing cold front and roughly with the cooling radius. Furthermore, a low star formation rate and uniform metal abundance up to the sloshing edge are consistent with the earlier findings of suppression of star formation and metallicity homogenisation by mixing core gas through sloshing. Finally, the spatial correlation between the mini-halo and the observed X-ray features indicates that ICM sloshing, rather than AGN feedback, plays a dominant role in powering the proposed radio mini-halo emission."}
