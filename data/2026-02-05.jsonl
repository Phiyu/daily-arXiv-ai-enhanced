The model is governed by three parameters: the coupling constant $ξ$, the energy scale of symmetry breaking $η$, and the bounce parameter $a$, which jointly influence horizon structure and observational signatures. Using specific heat and free-energy analysis, we show that small-horizon configurations are locally thermodynamically stable but never globally favored. Analytical solutions of null geodesics reveal that the photon sphere radius depends on the bounce parameter $a$ and the energy scale of symmetry breaking $η$, while the critical impact parameter is still unaffected by $a$. Moreover, the photon sphere radius and critical impact parameter, showing that increasing $η$ enlarges both quantities for an ordinary global monopole, while reducing them in the phantom case. Our results highlight how the bounce parameter and phantom global monopole significantly alter the black hole's physical and geometric properties."}

For this purpose we employed two horizons as infrared cut-offs, such as Hubble horizon and Ricci horizon. The analysis is conducted for a non-interacting scenario in a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. By considering a specific form of this modified gravity, we reconstruct the corresponding gravitational models based on these selected dark energy formulations. Additionally, a stability analysis is performed for all cases and the evolution of the equation of state parameter is examined. Our finding indicates that the reconstructed $f(R,T^2)$ models effectively describe both the phantom and quintessence phases of cosmic evolution, aligning with the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. This study highlights the deep interconnections between holographic dark energy models and modified gravity theories, offering valuable insights into the large scale dynamics of the cosmos."}

Beginning with the explicit equations of motion of a massive particle in the regular spacetime, we achieve the equation of the particle sphere and thus the radius of the unstable timelike circular orbit. It is interesting to find that the particle sphere equation can reduce to the well-known photon sphere equation, when the particle's initial velocity is equal to the speed of light. We adopt the strong field limit approach to calculate the black-bounce-Schwarzschild deflection angle of the particle subsequently, and obtain the strong-deflection lensing observables of the relativistic images of a pointlike particle source. The observables mainly include the apparent angular particle sphere radius, the angular separation between the outermost relativistic image and the other ones which are packed together, and the ratio between the particle-flux magnification of the outermost image and that of the packed ones (or equivalently, their resulted magnitudelike difference). The velocity effects induced by the deviation of the initial velocity of the particle from light speed on the corresponding strong-field lensing observables of the images of a pointlike light source in the regular geometry, along with these on the strong deflection limit coefficients and the critical impact parameter of the lightlike case, are then formulated. Serving as an application of the results, we finally concentrate on evaluating the astronomical detectability of the velocity effects on the lensing observables and analyzing their dependence on the parameters, by modeling the Galactic supermassive black hole (i.e., Sgr A$^{\\ast}$) as the lens."}

We find that: (1) The characterization of the PSF both in absolute scale and in shape is important, with biases in $Δσ^2/σ^2$ up to 1-6%, depending on the lens system. Small slit miscenterings of the lens are less important. (2) The difference between the measured velocity dispersion and the mean square velocity needed for the Jeans equations is important, with up to $Δσ^2/σ^2 \\sim$ 3-8%.

Using a residual multi-layer perceptron neural network, we predict the MFP at a given redshift as a function of the reionization redshift, photoionization rate, wavelength, and box-scale density, achieving a median relative error of 1.6\\% across nearly four orders of magnitude in MFP. Integrating its predictions over box-scale overdensity and an extended reionization history allows the emulator to predict the global MFP. We apply the emulator to extended reionization histories constrained by observed photoionization rates, finding that models prefer late reionization with substantial neutral fractions persisting at $z \\lesssim 6$. Fitting a parametric ionization history yields a midpoint of reionization of $z_{\\rm re} = 6.8\\pm 1.2$ for reionization durations consistent with Planck and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich constraints, and the universe being $10\\%$ neutral still at $z_{\\rm re} < 5.8 ~(6.3)$ at 1~(2)$σ$.

Recent studies suggest a much hotter (~0.7 keV) super-virial component detected in both absorption and emission. We want to shed light on the nature of this putative super-virial component. We analysed the X-ray background as observed by SRG/eROSITA over the entire western Galactic hemisphere. We show that low-mass stars provide a large fraction of the 0.7 keV emission. Indeed, a tight correlation is found between the surface brightness of the 0.7 keV emission and the mass distribution of the Milky Way across a large portion of the western Galactic hemisphere. The correlation coefficient implies an X-ray luminosity per unit of stellar mass comparable to that of the average low-mass stars within 10 pc of the Sun, suggesting that unresolved M dwarfs and F, G, and K type stars dominate the 0.7 keV emission. This emission is asymmetric with respect to the Galactic plane, influenced by the asymmetric distribution of nearby star-forming regions, and broadly consistent with the known offset of the Sun above the Galactic midplane. The remaining signal might be produced by the cumulative emission of stars of different types or ages, in addition to other sources (e.g. hot interstellar medium, Galactic corona, etc.). Assuming that the putative residual hot super-virial atmosphere is homogeneous and has a spherical beta profile with slope $β=0.4$, we constrain its density at 10 kpc to be $n_e<4\\times10^{-4}$~cm$^{-3}$.

An emergent underlying trend is that this Hubble tension is driven by data confined to the very low-redshift Universe (typically $z < 0.15$). Most intermediate-redshift measurements remain mutually consistent with $H_0^\\mathrm{CMB}$, the $Λ$CDM expectation anchored by the CMB. This Perspective examines if a large local void can explain the Hubble tension and its appearance only at low $z$. For an observer residing within a large underdensity, such as the Milky Way inside the claimed KBC void, gravitationally induced outflows and redshift can inflate the locally inferred recession scale $cz'$ despite having $H_0 = H_0^\\mathrm{CMB}$. We summarise evidence suggestive of a local underdensity from multi-wavelength galaxy number counts, discuss the dynamical requirements implied by the amplitude of inferred bulk flows, and connect the solution to the emerging low-redshift BAO distance anomaly ($α_{\\mathrm{iso}} < 1$). Previously published semi-analytic void models anticipated the observed redshift dependence of BAO deviations and predict a rapid convergence to CMB-consistent expansion for $z \\gtrsim 0.2$, aligning with reconstructions of $H_0(z)$ from BAO plus uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae. We conclude by looking to future tests, including improved mapping of the local density and velocity field, fits to galaxy distance catalogues at the field level, kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich constraints on coherent outflows, fast radio bursts, and the long-term prospect of redshift drift measurements as a direct probe of time-varying non-cosmological redshift contributions."}

Some universal properties and conclusions are obtained for these spacetimes. We mostly focus on the existence of photon spheres, the total number of photon spheres $n = n_{\\text{stable}} + n_{\\text{unstable}}$, the subtraction of stable photon sphere and unstable photon sphere $w = n_{\\text{stable}} - n_{\\text{unstable}}$ in different categories of spacetimes.

The stellar IMF may directly result from a Core Mass Function (CMF) through accretion, gravitational collapse, and fragmentation. This inheritance implies that the mass of the gaseous fragments may be connected to the properties of clustered and multiple stellar systems. We aim to (i) quantify the influence of hierarchical fragmentation of cores on the resulting IMF, and (ii) determine the consequences of this fragmentation on the multiplicity of the stellar systems. We employed a scale-free, hierarchical fragmentation model to investigate the fragmentation of top-heavy CMF. Hierarchical fragmentation of gas clumps shifts the CMF towards lower mass range and can modify its shape. Starting from the top-heavy power-law CMF observed in W43-MM2&MM3 star forming region, we show that at least four levels of hierarchical fragmentation are required to generate the turn-over peak of the cIMF. Within a radius of 0.2-2.5 kAU, massive stars (M > 10 Msun) have on average 0.9 companions, five times fewer than low-mass stars (M < 0.1 Msun); the latter are less dynamically stable and should disperse. We show that a universal IMF can emerge from mass-dependent fragmentation processes provided that more massive cores produce less fragments compared to lower mass cores and transfer their mass less efficiently to their fragments. Hierarchical fragmentation alone cannot reconcile a universal IMF with observed stellar multiplicity. We propose that fragmentation is not scale-free but operates in two distinct regimes: a mass-dependent phase establishing the Salpeter slope and a mass-independent phase setting the turn-over. Our framework provides a way to compare core subfragmentation in various star-forming regions and numerical simulations."}

This work seeks to better understand their possible chemical connections, with a focus on such molecules in the sources of the star-forming region Sgr B2 (N). The gas-phase reaction between ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and the halogens fluorine and chlorine was investigated via DFT calculations, with the goal of determining whether astrochemically viable chemical pathways leading to acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) exist. The studied reactions were then included in an astrochemical model of Sgr B2 (N) to determine their significance under real interstellar conditions. Our DFT calculations revealed that both chlorine and fluorine can react barrierlessly with ethanol to abstract a hydrogen atom. We further found that, following this initial step, the resulting ethanol radicals can undergo further reactions with atomic hydrogen, with some routes leading to acetaldehyde. Incorporation of these novel reactions in astrochemical models of hot cores suggest that they are indeed efficient under those conditions, and can lead to modest increases in the abundance of CH3CHO during model times where gas-phase ethanol is abundant. Of the ethanol radicals included in our chemical network, we found CH3CHOH to have the highest abundances in our simulations comparable to that of ethanol at some model times. Overall, this work reveals a novel gas-phase ``top-down'' link from alcohols to aldehydes that compliments the better studied ``bottom-up'' routes involving grain-surface H-addition reactions yielding alcohols from aldehydes. Moreover, results from our astrochemical models suggest that the ethanol radical CH3CHOH may be detectable in the interstellar medium."}

In this work, we combine the angular diameter distance measurements from recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) observations with luminosity distances reconstructed from Cosmic Chronometers data of Hubble parameter $H(z)$ using a non-parametric technique, Gaussian Process. A key part of our analysis is the systematic comparison of different BAO measurements (2D BAO, 3D BAO, and 3D DESI BAO) to determine whether any potential tension between angular and anisotropic BAO data affects constraints on the distance duality parameter $η(z)$ and $Ω_{k0}$. We adopt four representative parameterizations of $η(z)$ to examine the correlation between $η(z)$ and $Ω_{k0}$. Our results show no evidence for violation of the CDDR, with $η(z)$ consistent with unity at the 99\\% confidence level for all BAO datasets and parameterizations. In all scenarios, the best-fit values of $Ω_{k0}$ mildly favor a non-flat universe, although a spatially flat universe remains compatible at the 95\\% confidence level. The constraints on $η_1$ and $Ω_{k0}$ indicate slight variations across different BAO datasets, but the discrepancies between the 2D and 3D BAO measurements do not introduce any significant bias, and no statistically meaningful tension is observed. Our work provides robust constraints on cosmic curvature and the validity of the CDDR based on non-parametric distance reconstruction."}

We collect 840 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs at $z=2\\sim7$ from the literature and nearly 50\\% of them appear to have multiple components in JWST images. We further construct a sample of 248 LAEs that have two or more relatively isolated components in a circular aperture of 2$\\arcsec$ in diameter.

The trend persists for dark-matter halos or galaxies that are more closely related to the observables. We investigate the impact of the finite simulation box sizes on the measured velocity correlation functions of halos, utilizing N-body simulations with different box sizes. We measure the halo velocity correlations from N-body simulations with side lengths of $1{\\rm Gpc}/h$ and $2{\\rm Gpc}/h$, confirming the former is more suppressed compared to the linear theory prediction on large scales due to the lack of large-scale modes beyond the box size. In contrast, even though we subdivide the larger-box simulations into those with side lengths of $1{\\rm Gpc}/h$, the amount of the suppression is the same as that from the original boxes, as the large-scale modes are already imprinted. Introducing the lower limit of the integral in the Hankel transform, $k_{\\rm min}$, as a free parameter and marginalizing it over, we find that the constrained growth rate parameter, $f(z)σ_8(z)$, returns the correct value assumed in the simulations. However, when we ignore the effect and set $k_{\\rm min}=0$, the constraint on $fσ_8$ is significantly biased if the correlation between different separation bins is also ignored. Furthermore, we find that the suppression of the velocity correlation amplitude on large scales depends on halo mass, with more massive halos exhibiting a systematically stronger suppression.

We apply an adaptive kernel-density estimation method that incorporates the full photometric redshift probability distribution function of each galaxy to map galaxy overdensities, and identify 207 significant ($>4\\,σ$) overdensities at $1.5<z<5$. We measure the quenched-galaxy fraction, the median specific star formation rate (sSFR), the total halo mass, and the local galaxy density of each system. By investigating the correlation among these observables, we find that galaxy quenching proceeds in two paths:($i$) Overdensities within more massive halos exhibit higher quenched fractions and lower averaged sSFRs. This trend weakens at $z\\gtrsim2$, consistent with cold gas streams penetrating shock-heated massive halos and sustaining star formation activity at early times. ($ii$) We also find a dependence of the same parameters on local densities at $z<2$, where the quenched fraction increases and the sSFR decreases toward higher densities. The environmental trend in sSFR weakens at $z\\sim2$--$3$ and shows tentative evidence for a reversal at $z>3$, potentially due to a larger cold gas supply in earlier times.

The low-multipole convergence field, encodes the largest-angle coherent potential gradients, essential for assessment of large-angle features in data. To study this large angle signal, we perform a combined analytical, numerical and observational study. Starting from exact analytical expressions for the convergence power spectrum, we quantify how the dipole, quadrupole and octupole build up with source redshift and show that, in $Λ$CDM, they saturate at an amplitude of order $10^{-4}$. We then use full-sky, horizon-scale $N$-body simulations (Quijote) to explore the dependence of this signal on the observer's environment, comparing random observers to ``Milky Way-like'' observers. In parallel, we reconstruct the convergence field due to our local Universe with the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS), with proper treatment of incompleteness and galaxy bias. We find that the observed low multipoles from observation is above the $Λ$CDM mean predictions, but in full agreement with Milky Way-like observers in the simulation. Finally, by converting the convergence dipole into a number-count dipole, we test whether weak lensing can contribute to the cosmic dipole anomaly, an idea motivated by its natural alignment with the CMB dipole and by the fact that lensing, unlike clustering, cannot be removed by cross-matching surveys and thus survives in all high-redshift catalogues. We show that weak lensing by local structure contributes at most a few percent to this observed anomaly."}

Our results indicate that HNSO is efficiently produced on grain surfaces through reactions involving atomic oxygen and nitrogen atoms with the radicals NS and SO, forming NSO as a key intermediate. Subsequent hydrogenation of NSO leads to HNSO, with a clear preference for the lowest energy cis conformer, while the trans form is metastable and may be short-lived under typical interstellar conditions. The models predict that solid HNSO can reach abundances comparable to icy OCS, placing it among the major sulfur-bearing species in interstellar ices. Gas-phase abundances, in contrast, remain lower than those of OCS. The implementation of a multibinding scheme in our models clarifies the role of diffusive chemistry in the production of HNSO at early times, improving agreement with observations. These findings suggest that reactions involving diffusing O and N atoms on icy grains contribute significantly to sulfur chemistry and beyond in dense clouds and motivate further searches for molecules containing simultaneously H, N, O and S in other astronomical environments."}

The available maps to date, obtained from Planck space mission data, are noise-dominated in the high Galactic latitude regions that are most relevant for CMB observations. The goal of this work is to obtain better dust polarization maps from Planck observations, by exploiting both the dependence between polarization and total intensity, as well as the non-Gaussian filamentary structure of the dust emission. To this end, we use scattering transforms, which provide a stable and interpretable representation of complex non-Gaussian textures, allowing for a data-driven analysis approach requiring no explicit priors on dust. The analysis is performed locally on Cartesian patches of sky, where Stokes linear polarization parameters, redefined in a local reference frame, are modeled as the sum of a signal of interest and a nuisance term. Using multiple realizations of the random nuisance term, we recover the polarized dust maps by minimizing a composite objective function that enforces multiple statistical constraints in scattering space. The proposed algorithm reconstructs maps of polarized dust emission whose statistics are consistent with those expected from the Planck data once random nuisance realizations are added. This is confirmed in a validation test using a high signal-to-noise sky region as a test case. Comparisons with existing dust polarization maps and models show that our approach better recovers small-scale polarized dust emission, and that our reconstructed power and cross-spectra closely match those of the dust polarization maps. A second set of maps that deterministically reproduce the features of the dust polarized emission is also produced."}

They are driven by a resonant interaction between streaming dust and waves in a background medium, which results in dust density fluctuations and amplification of the waves. This broad class of instabilities includes recently-proposed modes incorporating acoustic and magnetohydrodynamic waves, as well as the well-studied disk streaming instability. As the study of RDIs is at an early stage, their evolution beyond the linear regime is not well understood. In order to make inroads into the nonlinear theory of RDIs, we performed simulations of the simplest case, the acoustic RDI, in which sound waves in a gas are amplified by interaction with supersonically streaming dust. This particular instability is of interest both due its potential relevance in various poorly ionized environments, and due to its resemblance to the fast magnetosonic RDI. We find that the nonlinear growth and saturation of the instability are characterized by a balance between time scales of instability growth and turbulent eddy turnover. The simulations demonstrate a saturated state possessing an anisotropic outer forcing range in which this balance is maintained, and suggest the presence of an isotropic turbulent inertial range below this scale. By presenting a model for the nonlinear growth and saturated state of the acoustic RDI, this work provides a framework for further study of the nonlinear behavior of this and other RDIs."}

However, we note that standard sirens do not offer a viable resolution to the Hubble tension in this analysis, as the inferred constraints are predominantly driven by the fiducial cosmologies adopted in the simulations. Regarding the specific models, we find that for the Hu-Sawicki scenario, several data combinations favor $F_{RR0}<0$, implying potential theoretical instabilities.

We then classify these tracers by their local density ($δ_{t,R}$) and measure the linear bias ($b_1$) and PNG-response ($b_φ$). Most $δ_{t,R}$ bins show a PNG-response compatible with $b_φ=0$ for all halos or the low-mass bin (log$M<11$). For high-mass halos (log$M>$12), QSO or LRG, we recover a trend closer to the universality relation ($b_φ= 2 δ_{\\rm crit}(b_1-1)$) for $b_1>1$, but the $b_φ(b_1)$ curve flattens to 0 below $\\vert b_1\\lvert<1$. Hence, we find $b_φ\\approx0$ for all bias-zero tracers considered. The complex $δ_{t,R}$-based selection causes their clustering to strongly deviate from simple assumptions, namely the universality relation and Poisson shot noise, hindering their capability to constrain PNG."}

The trend persists for dark-matter halos or galaxies that are more closely related to the observables. We investigate the impact of the finite simulation box sizes on the measured velocity correlation functions of halos, utilizing N-body simulations with different box sizes. We measure the halo velocity correlations from N-body simulations with side lengths of $1{\\rm Gpc}/h$ and $2{\\rm Gpc}/h$, confirming the former is more suppressed compared to the linear theory prediction on large scales due to the lack of large-scale modes beyond the box size. In contrast, even though we subdivide the larger-box simulations into those with side lengths of $1{\\rm Gpc}/h$, the amount of the suppression is the same as that from the original boxes, as the large-scale modes are already imprinted. Introducing the lower limit of the integral in the Hankel transform, $k_{\\rm min}$, as a free parameter and marginalizing it over, we find that the constrained growth rate parameter, $f(z)σ_8(z)$, returns the correct value assumed in the simulations. However, when we ignore the effect and set $k_{\\rm min}=0$, the constraint on $fσ_8$ is significantly biased if the correlation between different separation bins is also ignored. Furthermore, we find that the suppression of the velocity correlation amplitude on large scales depends on halo mass, with more massive halos exhibiting a systematically stronger suppression. These results highlight the importance of accounting for missing long-wavelength modes when developing simulation-based modeling of velocity statistics, such as emulators."}

The available maps to date, obtained from Planck space mission data, are noise-dominated in the high Galactic latitude regions that are most relevant for CMB observations. The goal of this work is to obtain better dust polarization maps from Planck observations, by exploiting both the dependence between polarization and total intensity, as well as the non-Gaussian filamentary structure of the dust emission. To this end, we use scattering transforms, which provide a stable and interpretable representation of complex non-Gaussian textures, allowing for a data-driven analysis approach requiring no explicit priors on dust. The analysis is performed locally on Cartesian patches of sky, where Stokes linear polarization parameters, redefined in a local reference frame, are modeled as the sum of a signal of interest and a nuisance term. Using multiple realizations of the random nuisance term, we recover the polarized dust maps by minimizing a composite objective function that enforces multiple statistical constraints in scattering space. The proposed algorithm reconstructs maps of polarized dust emission whose statistics are consistent with those expected from the Planck data once random nuisance realizations are added. This is confirmed in a validation test using a high signal-to-noise sky region as a test case. Comparisons with existing dust polarization maps and models show that our approach better recovers small-scale polarized dust emission, and that our reconstructed power and cross-spectra closely match those of the dust polarization maps. A second set of maps that deterministically reproduce the features of the dust polarized emission is also produced."}

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "Principled Bayesian inference of galaxy properties has not previously been performed for wide-area weak lensing surveys with millions of sources. We address this gap by applying the pop-cosmos generative model to perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting for 4 million KiDS-1000 galaxies. Calibrated on deep COSMOS2020 photometric data, pop-cosmos specifies a physically-motivated prior over the galaxy population up to $z \\simeq 6$ in stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameter space. Using the Speculator SPS emulator with GPU-accelerated MCMC sampling, we perform full posterior inference at 6.5 GPU seconds per galaxy, obtaining joint constraints on galaxy redshifts and physical properties. We validate photometric redshifts against $\\sim\\!185,\\!000$ KiDS galaxies cross-matched to DESI DR1 spectroscopic samples, achieving low bias ($3\\times10^{-3}$), scatter ($σ_{\\mathrm{MAD}}=0.04$), and outlier fraction (3.7%) for the Bright Galaxy Survey, with comparable performance (bias $3\\times10^{-2}$, $σ_{\\mathrm{MAD}}=0.05$, 1.3% outliers) for luminous red galaxies (LRGs). Within the LRG sample, we identify massive, dusty, star-forming contaminants at $z \\simeq 0.4$ satisfying standard colour selections for quenched populations. We infer trends in stellar mass, star formation, metallicity, and dust across five tomographic redshift bins consistent with established scaling relations. Using specific star formation rate constraints, we identify $\\sim$10% of KiDS-1000 galaxies as quenched, versus 37% implied by conservative colour cuts. This enables the construction of weak lensing samples defined by physical properties while mitigating intrinsic alignment systematics and preserving statistical power. Our analysis validates pop-cosmos out-of-sample, establishing it as a scaleable approach for galaxy evolution and cosmological analyses in photometric surveys."}

Velocity dispersions, $σ$, can be used to break the degeneracy, with uncertainties $ΔH/H_0 \\propto Δσ^2/σ^2$ ultimately limited by the systematic uncertainties in the kinematic measurements - measuring $H_0$ to 2% requires $Δσ^2/σ^2$ < 2%. Here we explore a broad range of potential systematic uncertainties contributing to eight time-delay lenses used in cosmological analyses. We find that: (1) The characterization of the PSF both in absolute scale and in shape is important, with biases in $Δσ^2/σ^2$ up to 1-6%, depending on the lens system. Small slit miscenterings of the lens are less important. (2) The difference between the measured velocity dispersion and the mean square velocity needed for the Jeans equations is important, with up to $Δσ^2/σ^2 \\sim$ 3-8%. (3) The choice of anisotropy models is important with maximum changes of $Δσ^2/σ^2 \\sim$ 5-18% and the frequently used Osipkov-Merritt models do not produce $h_4$ velocity moments typical of early-type galaxies. (4) Small differences between the true stellar mass distribution and the model light profile matter ($Δσ^2/σ^2 \\sim$ 5-40%), with radial color gradients further complicating the problem. Finally, we discuss how the homogeneity of the early-type galaxy population means that many dynamically related parameters must be marginalized over the lens sample as a whole and not over individual lenses."}

Using Bayesian inference with the state-of-the-art eccentric, spin-aligned, higher-mode effective-one-body model SEOBNRv5EHM, we reanalyze six previously suggested eccentric gravitational-wave events--GW190521, GW190620, GW190701, GW191109, GW200129, and GW200208\\_222617. Comparing results with its dominant-mode-only counterpart SEOBNRv5E, we find no statistically significant HOM-induced bias in eccentricity for any of these events, including GW190521, whose eccentricity has been debated in the literature. To identify parameter regimes vulnerable to HOM omission, we perform a broad zero-noise injection campaign varying detector-frame total mass, mass ratio, eccentricity, inclination, and network SNR. We find that significant systematic biases ($Δ_e/σ> 1$) arise predominantly in systems with high total mass ($M^{\\rm det}\\gtrsim120M_\\odot$), highly asymmetric mass ratios ($q \\gtrsim 4$), near edge-on orientations ($θ_\\textrm{JN} \\gtrsim 30^\\circ$), and high SNRs ($ρ^N_\\textrm{mf}\\approx50$). Notably, for quasi-circular BBHs with $M^{\\rm det}\\gtrsim140M_\\odot$, neglecting HOMs may lead to strong false-positive evidence for nonzero eccentricity. By contrast, for lower-mass systems ($M^{\\rm det}\\sim100 M_\\odot$), HOM exclusion produces negligible eccentricity biases. Our results demonstrate that although current eccentric candidates are not impacted by HOM omission, future eccentricity measurements--particularly for massive, asymmetric, or edge-on systems--require HOM-inclusive waveforms to avoid substantial systematic errors."}
