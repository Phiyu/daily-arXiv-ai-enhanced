The model separates a deterministic, non-stationary drift (piecewise linear mean) from stationary stochastic variability (Matérn and Spectral Mixture kernels), and jointly models multiple images with per-image microlensing. Bayesian evidence and parameter posteriors are obtained via nested sampling and marginalised over model choices. Applied to the quasars WFI J2033 - 4723, B 1608 + 656, and HE 0435 - 1223, we find strong evidence for non-stationarity in B 1608 + 656 and HE 0435 - 1223, while WFI J2033 - 4723 is consistent with stationarity. The stochastic component favours an Markovian exponential kernel for B 1608 + 656 and a non-Markovian Matérn-$\\frac32$ kernel for WFI J2033 - 4723 and HE 0435 - 1223. Multi-length-scale Spectral Mixture kernels are disfavoured. Time delays are shown to be robust to model assumptions and consistent with prior work within the error. We further identify and mitigate a likelihood pathology which biases toward large delays, providing a practical nested sampling convergence protocol."}

Using a linear combination (LC) pipeline, we obtain a suite of reconstructions that explore different trade-offs between statistical sensitivity and suppression of astrophysical contaminants, including minimum-variance, CMB-deprojected, and CIB-deprojected $y$-maps. We validate these maps through different statistical techniques such as auto- and cross-power spectra with large-scale structure tracers as well as stacking on cluster locations. These tests are used to understand the balance between noise and astrophysical foreground residuals (such as the CIB) in combination with the recovery of the tSZ signal for different maps. For example, results from stacking at the location of clusters confirm the robustness of the recovered tSZ signal over the $\\sim 1500\\: {\\rm deg}^2$ SPT-3G survey field used in this analysis.

However, single black holes can undergo ``stone skipping'', with their orbital radius varying quasi-periodically. We show that stone skipping is induced by the dipole excitation of the soliton. We model it as resonance in a forced, damped harmonic oscillator, demonstrating that the coherent response of the soliton can significantly modify the dynamics of objects orbiting within it. This suggests that a dipole perturbation of a soliton can modify inspiral timescales if the black holes masses are significantly less than the soliton mass, with implications for supermassive black hole dynamics, the final parsec problem and gravitational wave observations in a ULDM cosmology."}

We find differences in the spin and the concentrations of the LSBGs haloes and the host haloes of high-surface-brightness galaxies (HSBGs), consistent with previous studies. By analysing their spatial and kinematical distribution of satellites, we find that LSBGs tend to have a larger number of satellites than HSBGs and with a larger velocity dispersion. Moreover, we obtain a continuous relation between the number of satellites and surface brightness, particularly for massive central galaxies. We also find a relation between surface brightness and the relative tangential velocity of the satellites. For a given stellar mass, the existence of LSBGs is strongly correlated with their satellite system dominated by rotation. Furthermore, the satellite system is systematically in counter-rotation with respect to the primary disc in LSBGs. We propose that this fact reflects that these galaxies have not experienced a significantly high rate of mergers, which are more likely associated with radial orbits expected in systems of galaxies with a high surface brightness."}

By construction, the stochastic formalism relies on the separation of scales, which requires solving the equations for UV modes on top of the evolving IR modes for all modes at every time step, leading to a non-Markovian system in general. In this paper, working on a de Sitter background, we analyze several representative models by simultaneously solving the Langevin equations for IR modes and the equations for UV modes at each time step. We demonstrate that once the effects of effective masses are treated consistently by our simulation, the flat direction in the minimal supersymmtric model (MSSM) does not saturate but instead evolves as an exactly flat direction. Furthermore, we investigate memory effects in simple two models; $V=λφ^4$ and $V=μφχ+ λφ^4$, and non-Markovian contributions can lead to quantitative differences, even in stationary configurations, when compared with Markovian approximations, particularly in the strong-coupling regime."}

Our results indicate that the event horizon radius is sensitive to the inner slope parameter $a$; specifically, beyond a critical threshold, the horizon vanishes, leading to the formation of naked singularities. We find that the DM environment induces curvature singularities in the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars, which are absent in the vacuum BTZ case. Furthermore, an analysis of the effective energy-momentum tensor shows that while the null, weak, and strong energy conditions are strictly satisfied, the dominant energy condition is violated in the BTZ scenario due to the high tangential pressure gradient. We also observe that DM modifies the Hawking temperature and free energy without compromising local or global stability. Notably, the DM distribution transforms the originally constant-curvature BTZ spacetime into a singular one, suggesting that a inherent stiffness of the DM profile is a determinant factor in the causal structure of these solutions."}

Supernova (SN) feedback is one possible mechanism for clearing neutral gas channels to allow the escape of Lyman continuum photons. Here, we use SN discoveries in low-redshift analogs of high-redshift star-forming galaxies -- Green Pea galaxies and their even lower-redshift counterparts, Blueberry (BB) galaxies -- to understand how SNe shape the properties of their host galaxies at high redshifts. We cross-match 1242 BB galaxies with transient discovery reports and identify 11 SNe, ten of which are likely core-collapse SNe, and compare their hosts to the larger BB population. We find that SN-hosting BBs exhibit elevated star formation rates, burstier star formation histories within the last $\\sim$50 Myr, and higher stellar masses. We estimate the occurrence rates of SNe in BB galaxies, finding that the SN rate may be slightly suppressed in BBs compared to field galaxies of similar mass, but we are unable to fully control for observational uncertainties. Finally, SN hosts show bluer UV slopes than non-host BB galaxies at 2.1$σ$ significance and lower ionizing photon production efficiency at 7.9$σ$ significance; the former result offers modest support for the hypothesis that SN-driven feedback plays a role in facilitating the escape of ionizing photons, while the latter may imply that SN-driven quenching decreases the rate of ionizing photon production in compact star-forming galaxies during the epoch of reionization."}

However, their rarity makes environmental trends difficult to establish. We use the FLAMINGO simulation, which simultaneously reproduces the redshift distribution and number counts of SMGs. We use the DisPerSE to identify filamentary structures at $z=4$, 3, 2, 1.5, and 1. We define inner cluster-halo, outer cluster-halo, inner filament, outer filament, and void/wall environments at each redshift considering mass evolution of cluster-halos and density evolution of filaments. For a fixed stellar-mass cut of $M_* \\geq 10^{9}$ M$_{\\odot}$, the fraction of SMGs in the inner cluster-halo environment declines from $\\sim30\\%$ at $z=4$ to $\\sim3\\%$ by $z=1$, and similar trends are observed in other environments. The abundance of SMGs within a cluster-halo increases with halo mass, mirroring the increase in the total galaxy population. Consequently, the ratio of SMG halo occupation to that of all galaxies is largely insensitive to halo mass, but varies with redshift. In contrast, the ratio of the halo occupation of non-SMGs to that of all galaxies declines with halo mass and shows little redshift evolution. We show that the central and satellite SMGs form two distinct populations in inner cluster-halos. SMGs occupy the metal-rich side of the metallicity distribution, but rarely attain the highest metallicities because ongoing enrichment is limited by gas depletion. The brightest SMGs (S$_{850} > 10$ mJy) are found exclusively in inner cluster-halos, highlighting a strong connection between SMG luminosity and environmental density. Our results show that SMGs dominate star formation in dense environments, contributing up to $80\\%$ of the SFR in inner cluster-halos at $z=4$, but less than $50\\%$ in low-density regions."}

Our procedure -- which extends the work of Murata-Reall-Tanahashi to include charged scalar dynamics -- involves the fine-tuned scattering of wave packets within an initially super-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime. The resulting extremal solution develops an event horizon along which the energy density diverges and the charge density approaches a constant (i.e., the horizon forms with \"hair\"). We investigate this behavior from the perspective of critical phenomena in gravitational collapse, giving evidence that dynamical extremal black holes act as universal threshold solutions modulo this family-dependent hair. As in the linear instability of fixed extremal backgrounds, the scalar field decays outside the dynamical extremal horizon. But just inside the horizon, the scalar curvature appears to develop unbounded growth. This implies that near-threshold solutions without a black hole could develop correspondingly large curvatures visible from future null infinity."}

Using the Timing Argument (TA), calibrated with analog galaxy pairs from the AbacusSummit simulation, we estimate the total mass of the CenA/M83 system under the assumption that the line-of-sight (LoS) velocity is dominated by motion toward the system's barycenter.

We find that CPL inferences are strongly dataset-dependent. With CMB data alone, the broad geometric degeneracy in $(H_0,Ω_{\\rm m},w_0,w_a)$ admits an extrapolation tail that can extend to $q_0<-1$ (super-acceleration), whereas adding DESI DR2 BAO pulls the reconstruction toward a weakly accelerating or nearly coasting present-day Universe ($q_0\\simeq 0$). In contrast, combining CMB with PP\\&SH0ES and BAOtr yields a conventional moderately accelerating expansion ($-1<q_0\\lesssim 0$) and substantially reduces the Hubble tension. Across all combinations, $w(z\\to\\infty)=w_0+w_a<-1$, while at post-recombination redshifts the expansion remains matter dominated ($q\\to1/2$). The origin of this behavior can be traced to low-redshift distance information: BAOtr and DESI prefer different BAO distance ratios at $z\\lesssim 0.5$, which propagates into divergent expansion histories in CPL. In all cases, $r_{\\rm d}$ stays nearly unchanged, indicating that shifts in $H_0$ arise from late-time expansion freedom rather than early-Universe physics. Bayesian evidence mirrors this contingency: it is strong for CPL mainly when PP\\&SH0ES and/or BAOtr are included, while it is inconclusive for CMB-only and CMB+DESI and moderately favors $Λ$CDM for CMB+SDSS. Overall, our results show that the apparent support for CPL and its ability to ease the Hubble tension are not universal but depend sensitively on the adopted low-redshift distance data, motivating either more flexible late-time models or closer scrutiny of residual systematics in current BAO determinations."}

The Lagrangian contains functional forms of the bulk while the boundary terms do not contribute to the dynamics. The advantage of the proposition is that the stellar structure equations are up to order two thus the theory is not haunted by ghosts. We obtain explicitly the defining equations for the thermodynamical variables and the geometry for the pure quadratic case since the linear case amounts to general relativity. In trying to establish the vacuum geometry associated with the theory it turns out that two possible metrics emerge through the vanishing of the energy-momentum tensor. Next we analyse the isotropy equation and make the observation that it is autonomous. It is rare that this happens in astrophysical modelling. This behaviour prompted the use of dynamical systems to understand the stability properties of fixed points or fixed manifolds. It was necessary to choose a gauge in order to split the autonomous equation into a system from which we could plot a phase portrait and deduce the stability of solution trajectories. We find that the fixed curves were generally stable with nearby paths approaching the fixed curves."}

Our analysis combines X-ray data from the XMM-XXL survey with shear measurements from the three-year shape catalog of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. The analysis focuses on the XXL C1 sample, comprising 171 clusters for abundance modeling, a subset of 86 clusters located within the XXL-N region for lensing-based mass calibration, and 162 clusters with X-ray temperature and luminosity measurements used to constrain scaling relations. Using the density-estimation likelihood-free inference (DELFI) algorithm, we construct a forward model with 12 parameters that incorporates the XXL selection function and cluster population modeling and accounts for key systematic effects including cluster miscentering, photometric redshift bias, and mass-dependent weak-lensing bias. Our SBI analysis yields a constraint on the cosmological parameter $S_8 \\equiv σ_8 (Ω_{m}/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.867 \\pm 0.063$, with an additional 3% systematic uncertainty from neural network stochasticity.

Comments are welcomed. Accepted by Physical Review D", "summary": "The uncertainty principle constitutes a fundamental pillar of quantum theory, representing one of the most distinctive features that differentiates quantum mechanics from classical physics. In this study, we firstly propose a novel generalized entropic uncertainty relation (EUR) for arbitrary multi-measurement in the many-body systems, and rigorously derive a significantly tighter bound compared to existing formulations. Specifically, we discuss the proposed EUR in the context of Schwarzschild black hole, where we demonstrate the superior tightness of our derived bound. The study further elucidates the dynamical evolution of multipartite quantum coherence and entanglement in the curved spacetime. A particularly noteworthy finding reveals the exact equivalence between entanglement and $l_1$-norm coherence for arbitrary $N$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-type (GHZ-type) states. Moreover, we find that quantum coherence is significantly diminished and the measurement uncertainty increases to a stable maximum with increasing Hawking temperature. Thus, the findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of non-classicality and quantum resources in black holes."}

Using the Galacticus semi-analytic model applied to high-resolution N-body merger trees, we investigate potential quenching mechanisms to explain this trend. Our fiducial models, calibrated to the Milky Way, reproduce the overall Cen A population but overpredict the number of bright inner-halo satellites by a factor of 4 +- 1 at Mv < -15.8. We find that this is not due to statistical variance. Instead, the spatial coincidence of this deficiency with Cen A's massive, kiloparsec-scale radio lobes suggests a powerful environmental driver. We explore a range of physical scenarios, including enhanced tidal disruption, reionization quenching, and suppressed accretion into halos from the surrounding intergalactic medium. Our results indicate that AGN-driven thermal feedback at z < 5 can significantly suppress star formation in satellites, effectively truncating the bright end of the inner luminosity function. Our work suggests that the \"Curious Case of Centaurus A\" may provide evidence of AGN feedback within the host galaxy that regulates the survival and evolution of its dwarf galaxy satellites."}

A prime example is the likelihood of cross-correlation power spectra of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) fields at low multipoles, $\\ell\\lesssim 10$. In this paper, we investigate a parity-violating cross-correlation between $E$- and $B$- mode polarization fields using SBI. The $EB$ correlation at low $\\ell$ is essential to distinguish between possible axion dark energy and dark matter interpretations of `cosmic birefringence', a rotation of the plane of linear polarization of the CMB, recently reported from WMAP, Planck, and Atacama Cosmology Telescope data. We use neural likelihood estimation to infer the likelihood of the $EB$ correlation at low $\\ell$ and show that it is highly non-Gaussian. We then employ neural posterior estimation to constrain the scalar field mass ($m_φ$), the cosmic birefringence amplitude ($gφ_\\mathrm{in}/2$), and the instrumental miscalibration angle ($α$), from simulated datasets. We find that the posterior on $m_φ$ shows two regimes, with a transition marked by $10^{-32}$ eV, highlighting a strong sensitivity to the scale dependence of cosmic birefringence. To quantify this behavior, we compute the probability $p(m_φ < 10^{-32}$\\,eV) for various fiducial values of $m_φ$.

Relaxing standard assumptions, we fit flexible stellar density models to observations of the Milky Way's known dSph satellites. Considering various choices for the density profile shape and spatial extent of a host dark matter halo, we use the virial theorem to propagate observational uncertainties about the shapes of the inferred dSph stellar density profiles to uncertainties in the inferred dynamical masses. We find that the observed structural diversity of the Milky Way dSph population implies a large range of potential systematic errors (up to factors of 10) associated with standard dynamical mass estimators. We show that accounting for these observational and systematic uncertainties can significantly alter the appearance and behavior of dSph dynamical scaling relations, including enclosed dynamical mass vs. stellar mass and the Radial Acceleration Relation."}

Remarkably, we uncover a counterintuitive phenomenon: as the Hawking temperature increases, quantum entanglement ($1$-$3$ tangle) of the $CL_4$ state remains strictly constant, indicating a ``complete freezing of initially maximal entanglement\". This constitutes the first explicit example in which maximal entanglement remains perfectly preserved in a black hole environment, defying the conventional expectation that gravitational effects can only suppress maximal quantum correlations.

When the first astrochemical models including solid-state chemistry were developed more than forty years ago, data from dedicated laboratory experiments were limited. Since then, many groups have developed specific experimental setups to address this issue, but astrochemical models have rarely been directly confronted with these new results. We want to demonstrate whether it is possible to use rate-equation-type astrochemical models developed in the context of the Interstellar Medium to compare them with laboratory astrophysics experiments. In this work, we use the case of low-temperature hydrogenation of CO, which is known to lead to methanol, among other molecules. We carried out 9 experiments, varying the experimental parameters such as temperature and dose. We give quantitative results and take care of detailing the vocabulary used in the experiments. We use astrochemical codes, NAUTILUS, pyRate and MONACO, to reproduce our experimental conditions, which requires good control of the change of vocabulary and scales, especially for fluxes and time scales. This work demonstrates that it is possible to use different astrochemical codes to compare modelling results directly with the output of experiments. There are discrepancies between models and experiments, as well as between models, but a fair agreement is achieved. We discuss the possible origin of the differences, which could originate from the chemical network or the difference in the description of physical processes."}

This combined analysis yields $S_8 = 0.836^{+0.012}_{-0.013}$, providing a higher central value and reduced uncertainties compared to Planck alone. Compiling measurements from 2019--2026, we reveal a striking bifurcation: DES Year 6 results exhibit a statistically significant tension of $2.4σ$--$2.7σ$ \\citep{DESY6}, whereas KiDS Legacy results demonstrate statistical consistency at $<1σ$ \\citep{Wright2025}. We examine systematic origins of this dichotomy, including photometric redshift calibration, intrinsic alignment modeling, and shear measurement pipelines.

Holonomy corrections to the evaporation rate enter through the greybody factor, slowing down the evaporation process when the holonomy modification function decreases monotonically. Accounting for backreaction, corrected covariant semi-classical stress-energy tensors are computed in various vacuum states. Thanks to these results, the new concept of a net stress-energy tensor makes it possible to compute evaporation rates directly from energy conservation laws."}

Its filamentary morphology follows roughly that of the IR poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) bands. The EME signal in rhoOphW drops abruptly above ~30GHz and its spectrum can be interpreted in terms of electric-dipole radiation from spinning dust grains, or ``spinning dust''. Deep and high-fidelity imaging and spectroscopy of rhoOphW may reveal the detailed morphology of the EME signal, free from imaging priors, while also enabling a search for fine structure in its spectrum. The same observations may constrain the spectral index of the high-frequency drop. An ALMA Band1 mosaic yields a deep deconvolved image of the filament at 36-44GHz, which we use as template for the extraction of a spectrum via cross-correlation in the uv-plane. Simulations and cross-correlations on near-infrared ancillary data yield estimates of flux-loss and biases. The spectrum is a power law, with no detectable fine structure. It follows a spectral index alpha=-0.78+-0.05, in frequency, with some variations along the filament. Interestingly, the Band1 power at high spatial frequencies increases relative to that of the IR signal, with a factor of two more power in Band1 at ~20'' than at ~100'' (relative to IRAC3.6um). An extreme of such radio-only structures is a compact EME source, without IR counterpart. It is embedded in strong and filamentary Band1 signal, while the IRAC maps are smooth in the same region. We provide multi-frequency intensity estimates for spectral modelling."}

For 66 of these galaxies, we also measure a Pa-beta flux. We find that the Pa-beta/H-alpha line ratio increases strongly with stellar mass and star-formation rate (SFR) across our full mass range, indicating that more massive galaxies are dustier. We compare our results with a mass-, SFR-, and redshift-matched sample of galaxies from the MOSDEF survey with spectroscopic measurements of H-alpha/H-beta, finding that a shallow Reddy et al. (2025) nebular attenuation curve is more consistent with our observations than the typically assumed Cardelli et al. (1989) attenuation curve, especially for massive galaxies. This shallow attenuation curve could be explained by low dust covering fractions in star-forming regions. Through comparison to other studies, we show that assuming this shallower attenuation curve can increase the inferred A_Halpha,neb by up to 1 magnitude at high masses. We observe no trend between A_Halpha,neb and axis ratio, indicating that nebular attenuation is likely localized to small clumps.

Comments welcome", "summary": "We propose a new way to reconstruct the ionized-bubble size distribution during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) through the real-space cross-correlation of 21-cm and star-forming line-intensity maps. Understanding the evolution and timing of the EoR is crucial for both astrophysics and cosmology, and a wealth of information on the first sources can be extracted from the study of ionized bubbles. Nevertheless, directly mapping bubbles is challenging due to the high redshifts involved, possible selection biases, and foregrounds in 21-cm maps. Here, we exploit the real-space cross-correlation $ξ_{21,ν}$ between 21-cm and line-intensity mapping (LIM) signals to reconstruct the evolution of bubble sizes during reionization. For the first time, we show that $ξ_{21,ν}(r)$ departs from a saturation level for each separation $r$ when bubbles of size $r$ begin to form, providing a handle for the onset of bubbles of each radius. Moreover, we demonstrate that $ξ_{21,ν}$ evolves from positive to negative as the EoR progresses, reaching a minimum (i.e. maximum anti-correlation) when bubbles of radius $r$ reach peak abundance. We show that these results are robust to changes in the astrophysical model as well as the timing/topology of reionization. This real-space observable complements usual Fourier-space estimators by capturing the localized nature of bubbles, offering new insights into the sources driving cosmic reionization."}

Accepted for publication in MNRAS", "summary": "Resolved metallicity studies of local disk galaxies have revealed that their interstellar media (ISMs) are far from chemically homogeneous, displaying significant ($\\sim 0.05$ dex) variations in the metallicity on characteristic scales of a few hundred parsecs. Such data is at odds with most analytical models, where the ISM is predicted to be more well-mixed. Here, we suggest that the observed small-scale features seen in galaxies may be superbubbles of metal-enriched gas created by a collection of core collapse supernovae with tight spatial (and temporal) correlation. In this scenario, the size of the metallicity fluctuations (superbubble radius, $φ$) is set by the disk scale height of the galaxy in question (after which point shock breakout favours preferential expansion along directions perpendicular to the dense disc), and the amount of additional metals contained within a fluctuation is proportional to the star formation efficiency in superbubble regions ($ε$). To test this theory, we analysed metallicity maps from the PHANGS-MUSE sample of galaxies using a geostatistical forward-modelling approach. We find $φ\\simeq 300$ pc and $ε= 0.1-0.2$, in good agreement with our theoretical model. Further, these small-scale parameters are found to be related to the global galaxy properties, suggesting that the local structure of the interstellar medium of galaxies is not universal. Such a model of star formation paints a new picture of galaxy evolution in the modern universe: in large local galaxies, star formation appears steady and regular when averaged over large scales. However, on small scales, these large galaxies remain intrinsically bursty like their smaller, high-redshift counterparts."}

The results demonstrate that higher modes are essential in breaking degeneracies, and coincident observations by the detector network can significantly improve the measurement of source properties. Additionally, automatic differentiation provides an accurate way to obtain the Fisher matrix without manual fine-tuning of the finite difference step size. Using a subset of extrinsic parameters, we show that the approximated posteriors obtained by the Fisher matrix agree well with those derived from Bayesian parameter estimation."}

Although active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback has been proposed as a key driver of this transition, the lack of strong AGN in nearby quenching galaxies raises questions about its effectiveness. In this study, we investigate AGN activity in post-starburst galaxies (PSBs), star-forming galaxies (SFGs), and quiescent galaxies (QGs) at $z<$ 0.2, using multiwavelength data from eROSITA/eFEDS (X-ray), WISE (mid-infrared), and FIRST (radio). We assess AGN incidence and strength across different stages and apply stacking techniques to undetected galaxies to recover average AGN properties. Comparisons between observed luminosity and that expected from star formation (L$_{\\rm obs}$/L$_{\\rm SF}$) show that PSBs are consistent with star formation dominating their radio and X-ray emission. Although PSBs exhibit a MIR AGN incidence rate twice that of SFGs, their estimated AGN luminosities are small compared to those of MIR AGN in the literature. PSBs overall do not display significantly enhanced AGN emission relative to mass- and redshift-matched SFGs and QGs. While the presence of obscured, low-luminosity AGN in PSBs cannot be excluded, such AGN, if present, could be fueled by residual gas from the preceding starburst and may not play a dominant role in quenching. Our findings suggest that AGN's role in quenching at low redshift is more subtle than violently removing the gas -- the feedback is likely more \"preventive\" than \"ejective\"."}

Thus, the dynamical inference of a dSph's gravitational potential is necessarily sensitive to assumptions about that shape. Relaxing standard assumptions, we fit flexible stellar density models to observations of the Milky Way's known dSph satellites. Considering various choices for the density profile shape and spatial extent of a host dark matter halo, we use the virial theorem to propagate observational uncertainties about the shapes of the inferred dSph stellar density profiles to uncertainties in the inferred dynamical masses. We find that the observed structural diversity of the Milky Way dSph population implies a large range of potential systematic errors (up to factors of 10) associated with standard dynamical mass estimators. We show that accounting for these observational and systematic uncertainties can significantly alter the appearance and behavior of dSph dynamical scaling relations, including enclosed dynamical mass vs. stellar mass and the Radial Acceleration Relation."}

We develop a unified framework to study PBH formation in dust-radiation bouncing cosmologies, focusing on the classical contracting phase so that the results are insensitive to bounce details. We compute the curvature power spectrum for an extremely small dust equation of state using a stable semi-analytical (adiabatic) method, derive the Jeans length of the two-fluid system using dynamical-system analysis and the WKB approximation, and extend the three-zone model from the single- to the two-fluid case to model local collapse. We implement two collapse criteria to obtain the curvature perturbation threshold for PBH formation and estimate PBH mass fractions for benchmark masses spanning low-mass ($10^{-17} M_{\\odot}$) to supermassive ($10^{13} M_{\\odot}$) scales. The critical curvature threshold is extremely small and nearly mass-independent over a broad range $(ζ_c \\sim 10^{-21}$ for $10^{-14}$ to $10^{13} M_{\\odot})$, with deviations only near dust-radiation equality. Nevertheless, the square root of the curvature power spectrum at the relevant formation times is many orders of magnitude smaller, yielding vanishingly small PBH mass fractions across the benchmark masses. Compared with the pure-dust case, radiation pressure and the two-fluid collapse conditions significantly suppress PBH production, implying that substantial PBH formation in dust-radiation bouncing cosmologies would require additional mechanisms to amplify curvature perturbations."}

The previous targets are limited to bright quasars ($M_{1450}\\lesssim-25$), for which photoevaporation may hinder galaxy formation in their vicinity. Here, we present Subaru/Hyper-Suprime Cam observations of the environments of four low-luminosity quasars ($-24<M_{1450}<-22$) at $z\\sim6.18$, which are expected to have a smaller photoevaporation effect. We detect Lyman $α$ emitters (LAEs) around them with narrowband NB872 imaging, and measure the local LAE overdensity.

The result is confirmed over the proximity zone of each quasar, suggesting that the diverse environment around quasars is independent of photoevaporation. We find no significant correlation between the LAE overdensities and the properties of host galaxies and supermassive black holes. Our quasars have host stellar mass measurements from JWST, allowing us to compare them with the LAE overdensity around galaxies without quasar activity with comparable stellar masses.

The prevailing view, developed over decades, holds that this relaxation is rapidly filtered into a linear regime, establishing linear perturbation theory as the bedrock of black hole spectroscopy and a key pillar of gravitational-wave physics. Here we unveil a distinct nonlinear regime that transcends the traditional paradigm: before the familiar linear ringdown, an intrinsically nonlinear, long-lived bottleneck can dominate the evolution. This stage is controlled by a saddle-node ghost in phase space, which traps the remnant and delays the onset of linearity by a timescale obeying a universal power-law. The ghost imprints a distinctive quiescence-burst signature on the emitted radiation: a prolonged silence followed by a violent burst and a delayed ringdown. Rooted in the bifurcation topology, it extends naturally to neutron and boson stars, echoing a topological universality shared with diverse nonlinear systems in nature. Our results expose a missing nonlinear chapter in gravitational dynamics and identify ghost-induced quiescence-burst patterns as clear targets for future observations."}

We analyse galaxies spectroscopically observed by JWST/NIRSpec Prism and confirmed to lie at $z>9$, with sufficient signal-to-noise to carefully model their rest-frame UV to optical continua and line emission. In particular, we model the damped Lyman-$α$ (Ly$α$) absorption (DLA) features of each galaxy to place observational constraints on the gas assembly of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) onto the galaxy halos at the onset of cosmic reionisation. Based on the derived HI column densities and star-formation rate (SFR) surface densities, we show that all galaxies are highly efficient at forming stars on rapid $\\sim 10-100\\,$Myr depletion timescales, greatly in excess compared to the canonical local universe Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and predictions from state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations. The dense HI gas appears to also drive the offset from the fundamental-metallicity relation of these galaxies though its dust-to-gas ratio is seemingly consistent with values derived for local galaxies except for the lowest metallicity sight-lines. Our results provide the first robust observational constraints on the impact of pristine HI gas on early galaxy assembly, and imply that a combination of highly efficient star formation and low dust obscuration can likely explain the UV-brightness of galaxies at cosmic dawn."}

Models of the Galactic electron density are thus widely used to predict distances and scattering of compact radio sources (including pulsars, fast radio bursts (FRBs), and long-period transients), in addition to mitigating ISM foregrounds in Galactic and extragalactic studies. We use a sample of 171 precise pulsar distances, based entirely on parallaxes and globular cluster associations, as well as scattering measurements of 568 pulsars, active galactic nuclei, and masers, to update the NE2001 Galactic electron density model. We refit the thick and thin disks and three of the spiral arms. The new parameters for these large-scale components significantly repartition free electrons between the thick disk and spiral arms, thereby correcting NE2001's systematic underestimation of pulsar distance and scattering.

Using a linear combination (LC) pipeline, we obtain a suite of reconstructions that explore different trade-offs between statistical sensitivity and suppression of astrophysical contaminants, including minimum-variance, CMB-deprojected, and CIB-deprojected $y$-maps. We validate these maps through different statistical techniques such as auto- and cross-power spectra with large-scale structure tracers as well as stacking on cluster locations. These tests are used to understand the balance between noise and astrophysical foreground residuals (such as the CIB) in combination with the recovery of the tSZ signal for different maps. For example, results from stacking at the location of clusters confirm the robustness of the recovered tSZ signal over the $\\sim 1500\\: {\\rm deg}^2$ SPT-3G survey field used in this analysis. The high-resolution and low-noise maps produced here provide an important cosmological tool for future studies, including measurements of the Compton-$y$ map power spectrum, cross-correlations with other tracers of the large-scale structure, detailed modeling of cluster pressure profiles, and study of the thermodynamic state of the baryons in the Universe."}

By construction, the stochastic formalism relies on the separation of scales, which requires solving the equations for UV modes on top of the evolving IR modes for all modes at every time step, leading to a non-Markovian system in general. In this paper, working on a de Sitter background, we analyze several representative models by simultaneously solving the Langevin equations for IR modes and the equations for UV modes at each time step. We demonstrate that once the effects of effective masses are treated consistently by our simulation, the flat direction in the minimal supersymmtric model (MSSM) does not saturate but instead evolves as an exactly flat direction. Furthermore, we investigate memory effects in simple two models; $V=λφ^4$ and $V=μφχ+ λφ^4$, and non-Markovian contributions can lead to quantitative differences, even in stationary configurations, when compared with Markovian approximations, particularly in the strong-coupling regime."}

However, single black holes can undergo ``stone skipping'', with their orbital radius varying quasi-periodically. We show that stone skipping is induced by the dipole excitation of the soliton. We model it as resonance in a forced, damped harmonic oscillator, demonstrating that the coherent response of the soliton can significantly modify the dynamics of objects orbiting within it. This suggests that a dipole perturbation of a soliton can modify inspiral timescales if the black holes masses are significantly less than the soliton mass, with implications for supermassive black hole dynamics, the final parsec problem and gravitational wave observations in a ULDM cosmology."}

We also discuss the connection between the obtained projected constraints and the recent microlensing observations by the HSC collaboration of the Andromeda Galaxy."}

However, their rarity makes environmental trends difficult to establish. We use the FLAMINGO simulation, which simultaneously reproduces the redshift distribution and number counts of SMGs. We use the DisPerSE to identify filamentary structures at $z=4$, 3, 2, 1.5, and 1. We define inner cluster-halo, outer cluster-halo, inner filament, outer filament, and void/wall environments at each redshift considering mass evolution of cluster-halos and density evolution of filaments. For a fixed stellar-mass cut of $M_* \\geq 10^{9}$ M$_{\\odot}$, the fraction of SMGs in the inner cluster-halo environment declines from $\\sim30\\%$ at $z=4$ to $\\sim3\\%$ by $z=1$, and similar trends are observed in other environments. The abundance of SMGs within a cluster-halo increases with halo mass, mirroring the increase in the total galaxy population. Consequently, the ratio of SMG halo occupation to that of all galaxies is largely insensitive to halo mass, but varies with redshift. In contrast, the ratio of the halo occupation of non-SMGs to that of all galaxies declines with halo mass and shows little redshift evolution. We show that the central and satellite SMGs form two distinct populations in inner cluster-halos. SMGs occupy the metal-rich side of the metallicity distribution, but rarely attain the highest metallicities because ongoing enrichment is limited by gas depletion. The brightest SMGs (S$_{850} > 10$ mJy) are found exclusively in inner cluster-halos, highlighting a strong connection between SMG luminosity and environmental density. Our results show that SMGs dominate star formation in dense environments, contributing up to $80\\%$ of the SFR in inner cluster-halos at $z=4$, but less than $50\\%$ in low-density regions."}

Motivated by studies of images produced by regular stars, it has been proposed that optical appearances caused by compact stars acting as gravitational lenses may account for this central bright spot. We further suggest that images produced by regular stars exhibit additional characteristics distinct from those of ordinary black holes, such as the possible partial or complete absence of secondary images. These phenomena may serve as favorable observational criteria for identifying regular stars in future searches."}

Muñoz", "Ely D. Kovetz"], "title": "Reionization Bubbles from Real-Space Cross Correlations of Line Intensity Maps", "comment": "11 pages, 8 figures, 1 table. Comments welcome", "summary": "We propose a new way to reconstruct the ionized-bubble size distribution during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) through the real-space cross-correlation of 21-cm and star-forming line-intensity maps. Understanding the evolution and timing of the EoR is crucial for both astrophysics and cosmology, and a wealth of information on the first sources can be extracted from the study of ionized bubbles. Nevertheless, directly mapping bubbles is challenging due to the high redshifts involved, possible selection biases, and foregrounds in 21-cm maps. Here, we exploit the real-space cross-correlation $ξ_{21,ν}$ between 21-cm and line-intensity mapping (LIM) signals to reconstruct the evolution of bubble sizes during reionization. For the first time, we show that $ξ_{21,ν}(r)$ departs from a saturation level for each separation $r$ when bubbles of size $r$ begin to form, providing a handle for the onset of bubbles of each radius. Moreover, we demonstrate that $ξ_{21,ν}$ evolves from positive to negative as the EoR progresses, reaching a minimum (i.e. maximum anti-correlation) when bubbles of radius $r$ reach peak abundance. We show that these results are robust to changes in the astrophysical model as well as the timing/topology of reionization. This real-space observable complements usual Fourier-space estimators by capturing the localized nature of bubbles, offering new insights into the sources driving cosmic reionization."}
