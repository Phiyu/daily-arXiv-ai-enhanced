Specifically, we train a neural network to translate Nuker profile parameters into analytically deprojectable Multi Gaussian Expansion components, enabling physically realistic stellar mass models without requiring optical observations. We integrate this model into SuperMAGE, a differentiable dynamical modelling pipeline for Bayesian inference of supermassive black hole masses. Applied to ALMA data, our approach finds results consistent with state-of-the-art models while extending applicability to dust-obscured and active galaxies where optical data analysis is challenging."}

Three of the four CO emitters are multiple images of the same galaxy. Compared to previous line-emitter searches in ALMA deep fields, our sample probes molecular gas masses $\\sim$1 dex below the lower bound, thanks to gravitational lensing (typically $μ\\sim 4$, up to $\\sim$30 in extreme cases). Most emitters are located in a region similar to normal star-forming galaxies in the star formation rate (SFR) versus molecular gas mass plane. To reduce dependence on SFR and stellar mass, we analyzed the molecular gas fraction and depletion timescale as a function of distance from the star-formation main sequence. We found that most emitters broadly follow the scaling relations from previous studies, consistent within the intrinsic scatter. In addition, we serendipitously detected the CH $N = 1$, $J = 3/2 \\rightarrow 1/2$ $Λ$-doublet transition from one CO emitter at $z = 1.142$, representing the first detection of CH from an individual galaxy at cosmological distances through a blind survey. The CH/CO column density ratio of $\\sim$$10^{-4}$ is comparable to that of local AGN-host galaxies, suggesting that CH traces molecular gas associated with AGN activity, possibly irradiated by X-rays."}

Detection thresholds are established through peak SNR statistics and analysis of inverted maps. In this paper, we focus on the ALMA-accessible CANDELS fields (COSMOS, GOODS-S, and UDS), covering ~130,000 optical/NIR-selected galaxies spanning $0.0 < z < 15.0$. We identify 1288 detections (622 unique) with optical/NIR counterparts across the two methods, of which 832 detections (395 unique) appear in both.

ECOGAL expands the parameter space previously explored by $A^3COSMOS$ and $A^3GOODS-S$ by incorporating the UDS field and integrating publicly available JWST datasets from the DAWN JWST Archive (DJA). We also highlight several science cases enabled by ECOGAL, including the evolution of cosmic gas and dust masses, obscured star formation and optically dark systems. ECOGAL provides science-ready data sets for the community and showcases the power of combining over a decade of accumulated public data with other legacy datasets. The data product is made publicly available and accompanies a post demonstrating the usage of the catalogue on the DJA webpage."}

We investigate the astrophysical origin of C using models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) appropriate for the Milky Way disk. We benchmark our results against APOGEE subgiant abundances. The trend between [C/Mg] and [Mg/H] is set by the total C yield as a function of metallicity. Observations indicate a gently rising [C/Mg] with [Mg/H], but AGB C production is predicted to decline with metallicity. Our sample therefore favours a scenario in which CCSN yields rise with metallicity to offset declining AGB C yields and drive a subtle increase in [C/Mg] with [Mg/H]. This result is consistent with massive star nucleosynthesis models incorporating rotation. The [C/Mg]-[Mg/Fe] trend is sensitive to delayed enrichment and therefore constrains the amount of AGB C production. Given the slope of this relation, we find that AGB stars likely account for 10-40 per cent of C at solar metallicity. Artificially shifting the AGB C yields towards lower mass stars with longer lifetimes also improves agreement with the observed [C/Mg]-[Mg/Fe] trend, possibly indicating a discrepancy with stellar evolution predictions or our assumed Fe production rate."}

We recast the dark sector, cosmic acceleration, large-scale structure, and cosmic tensions as emergent consequences of nonlocal memory and intrinsically persistent organization in a self-gravitating Universe. By introducing a maximum-caliber weight on cosmic histories and a bias functional encoding structural memory, we derive modified Friedmann, Boltzmann, and Poisson equations that naturally generate dark energy-like acceleration, dark matter-like clustering, and scale-dependent growth suppression. We also show how this approach can naturally help alleviate the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, can produce anisotropic velocity fields, and predict environment-dependent halo signatures that cannot arise from particle dark matter or scalar-field dark energy. We also derive a generalized horizon entropy and temperature, revealing a nonequilibrium statistical origin for cosmic acceleration and formulating a Law of Universal Arbitrage Equilibrium that governs the evolution of the Universe, showing that it is expanding towards a continuous form of Nash equilibrium. Cosmological Teleodynamics therefore offers a unified, emergent, and testable alternative to the conventional dark sector, rooted not in new particles but in the intrinsic statistical and systemic structure of cosmic memory, and shows that the universe itself operates like a giant potential game."}

Operationally, Matsas, Pleitez, Saa, and Vanzella (MPSV) have recently argued that relativistic spacetime requires only a single fundamental dimensional constant. Mathematically, theorems due to Alexandrov and Zeeman demonstrate that the light-cone structure determines the spacetime geometry only up to a conformal factor. We show that these approaches are mutually reinforcing: the Alexandrov-Zeeman theorems establish the rigid conformal structure of spacetime, while the ``bona fide clock'' required by MPSV serves the necessary mathematical role of breaking the dilation symmetry. We provide a formal derivation proving that the normalization of a single clock worldline is sufficient to select a unique metric from the conformal class, thereby clarifying that the number of fundamental constants is exactly one."}

It is known that dust is injected into the interstellar medium during early star formation by supernovae and later on by evolved stars. From individual objects, these mechanisms are well understood, but the overall dust production in star clusters at different evolutionary stages is still challenging to quantify. We present 22 massive (> 105M$_{\\odot}$) extra galactic star clusters with ages between 3 and 100 Myr exhibiting a compact dust morphology seen with JWST-MIRI. We only find PAH features associated with one star cluster and nineteen have already cleared themselves from their natal dust. Their main characteristic is a significant enhancement at 10$μ$m, which is likely due to silicate emission and cannot be explained by ionized gas. We discuss several possible explanations including dust production from evolved stars such as red super giants, more exotic star types like yellow hypergiants and luminous blue variable stars. Stochastic dust injection from supernovae or a single supernova in dense gas can also create significant silicate emission. However, for this scenario secondary tracers such as a X-ray signal are expected which we only observe in three star clusters. We find the most luminous 10$μ$m emitter to be the three most massive star clusters (> 106M$_{\\odot}$) which is at least a magnitude stronger than any known stellar sources indicating a rare mechanism that only appears at extreme masses and a short lifetime."}

Utilizing the dataset and Effective Field Theory (EFT)-based pipeline described in Paper 1, we constrain cosmological models with massive neutrinos ($Λ$CDM+$M_ν$), spatial curvature ($oΛ$CDM), dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a$CDM), and their combinations using the power spectrum and bispectrum of DESI galaxies and quasars. Our work also presents the first measurements of relevant non-minimal cosmological parameters from the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and DESI full-shape (FS) data, which are made possible thanks to carefully chosen priors on EFT parameters. We find that the addition the FS likelihood to DESI's baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data improves the limits on the spatial curvature by a factor of two over the BAO only results, though the improvements are less significant with the CMB data. The dark energy equation of state figure-of-merit increases both with and without the supernovae data (SNe), by $\\approx30\\%$ and $\\approx20\\%$ relative to the CMB+BAO and CMB+BAO+SNe results, respectively. Our FS likelihood also yields the strongest CMB-independent constraint on the total neutrino mass $M_ν<0.32\\,{\\rm eV}$, with the $30\\%$ improvement due to the bispectrum. In combination with the CMB, we find a $14\\%$ improvement assuming the $Λ$CDM+$M_ν$ model (yielding $M_ν<0.059\\,{\\rm eV}$), but this increases to $22\\%$ when using non-minimal backgrounds: $M_ν<0.097\\,{\\rm eV}$ in $oΛ$CDM+$M_ν$ and $M_ν<0.13\\,{\\rm eV}$ in $w_0w_a$CDM+$M_ν$.

Recently, with the aid of deep learning, gravitational waves have been efficiently and delicately extracted from the noisy data compared with the traditional match-filtering. While most of the relevant studies adopt the data in the time series only, the time-frequency data processing is also in progress due to its several advantages for the waveform denoising. Here, we target the gravitational waves events emitted by binary black hole (BBH) mergers, with their total mass larger than 30 solar masses. For denoising, we propose a deep learning model utilizing the Griffin-Lim algorithm, an existing numerical approach to restore the phase information from the related amplitude spectrogram. This design allows extra attention on the phase recovery by using a priorly denoised amplitude spectrogram. The denoising results fit well in both the amplitude and the phase alignments of the mock injected waveforms. We also apply our model to the real detected events and discover a nice consistency with the simulated template waveforms, especially the high accuracy around the merger stage. Our work suggests the possibility of a better methodological design for gravitational wave data analysis."}

We use 17 simulated low-mass galaxies from the Auriga Project ($\\sim 3 \\times 10^8 \\, M_\\odot \\leq M_* \\lesssim 2 \\times 10^{10} \\, M_\\odot$). We study the metallicity and the ages of these galaxies and their stellar halos, as well as the relation between these two properties. We find that all galaxies have negative radial [Fe/H] gradients, and that the centres of less massive dwarfs are generally more metal poor than those of more massive dwarfs. We find no correlation between the metallicity gradients and intrinsic galaxy properties, such as stellar mass or accreted stellar mass, suggesting that these gradients are not a simple byproduct of galaxy evolution in the low-mass regime. We also find that the dispersion in the mass-metallicity relation found in the stellar halos of low-mass galaxies can be explained with the infall time of their most dominant satellite: at a fixed accreted stellar halo mass, dwarf galaxies that accreted this satellite at later times have more metal-rich accreted stellar halos. Regarding the ages of the analysed galaxies, we find a prominent U-shape in the radial mean age profiles of $\\sim 65\\%$ of them, which is mainly driven by the in situ stellar material. This presence of a U-shape in the age profiles is due to the combination of the cessation of recent star formation at large radial distances and the merger events these galaxies undergo, which redistribute the stellar material to their outer regions. When focusing on the ages of the stellar halos, we find that more massive ones are older than less massive ones. Our results show a wide variety in ages and metallicities of low-mass galaxies and their stellar halos, reflecting the complex and non-uniform evolutionary pathways these systems can follow."}

While previous work has focused on point-like lenses such as primordial black holes, we extend this framework to extended dark objects (EDOs), including ultracompact minihalos formed from the collapse of primordial overdensities. We develop an analytic model of microlensing by EDOs embedded in a macrolensing cluster potential and derive the resulting caustics and light curves. Depending on the EDO size relative to the effective Einstein radius, we show that they may generate additional narrow caustics, leading to novel features in the light curve. Applying our framework to the MACS J1149 LS1 ``Icarus'' event, we constrain EDOs with radii up to $10^7 R_\\odot$. Our results demonstrate that caustic-crossing events complement galactic microlensing searches, as they can probe EDOs with larger physical size.

Since the coherent states are not orthogonal, an initial quasiclassical geometry is dynamically driven into a superposition of different amplitudes. Our framework provides a dynamical mechanism for tunneling between geometries that is ubiquitous in a number of approaches to quantum gravity, from loop quantum gravity to the Euclidean path integral. We apply our framework to the problem of black hole evaporation, providing a hint at how unitarity may be preserved with the inclusion of quantum corrections to the semiclassical evolution of the black hole."}

Here we present the empirical relation between SFR and broadband optical-to-NIR colors learned from Spitzer MIPS and Herschel PACS/SPIRE imaging using an innovative stacking analysis that bins galaxies with similar optical-to-NIR spectral energy distributions using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM). Stacking based on optical-to-NIR colors ensures that our FIR stacks are built from galaxies with similar intrinsic physical properties as opposed to stacking simply by stellar mass. We train a 40$\\times$40 SOM using 230,638 galaxies selected from the COSMOS field, and stack the mid-to-far infrared images from 24 micron to 500 micron. We are able to measure the median FIR luminosities from half of the SOM cells to calibrate the star formation rate.

Controlling angular systematics in the Euclid spectroscopic galaxy sample", "comment": "submitted to A&A; 34 pages, 18 figures, 4 appendices", "summary": "We present the strategy to identify and mitigate potential sources of angular systematics in the Euclid spectroscopic galaxy survey, and we quantify their impact on galaxy clustering measurements and cosmological parameter estimation. We first survey the Euclid processing pipeline to identify all evident, potential sources of systematics, and classify them into two broad classes: angular systematics, which modulate the galaxy number density across the sky, and catastrophic redshift errors, which lead to interlopers in the galaxy sample. We then use simulated spectroscopic surveys to test our ability to mitigate angular systematics by constructing a random catalogue that represents the visibility mask of the survey; this is a dense set of intrinsically unclustered objects, subject to the same selection effects as the data catalogue. The construction of this random catalogue relies on a detection model, which gives the probability of reliably measuring the galaxy redshift as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of its emission lines. We demonstrate that, in the ideal case of a perfect knowledge of the visibility mask, the galaxy power spectrum in the presence of systematics is recovered, to within sub-percent accuracy, by convolving a theory power spectrum with a window function obtained from the random catalogue itself. In the case of only approximate knowledge of the visibility mask, we test the stability of power spectrum measurements and cosmological parameter posteriors by using perturbed versions of the random catalogue. We find that significant effects are limited to very large scales, and parameter estimation remains robust, with the most impacting effects being connected to the calibration of the detection model."}

When the negative Casimir energy is taken as the source, this framework reduces to the Maldacena-Milekhin-Popov construction for magnetically charged wormholes. We then show that, in contrast, such perturbative constructions cannot be realized within the effective field theory approach to higher-derivative corrections. Remarkably, this conclusion holds irrespective of the specific form of the correction terms. The key observation is that the enhanced symmetries in the near-horizon region severely constrain the effective energy-momentum tensor near the throat. This prevents the formation of the traversable throat structure. Our analysis therefore establishes no-go theorems: traversable wormholes cannot arise perturbatively from Reissner-Nordström or Myers-Perry black holes in an effective field theory approach. Their realization would require either new ingredients, such as Casimir energy, or black holes with reduced symmetry."}

Such a black hole has a single (external) horizon located very near the Schwarzschild radius, $r_h=2M$, while its surface of unstable bound geodesics (photon sphere) is located at a moderately shortened radius than its Schwarzschild counterpart. Relying on a geometrically and optically thin accretion disk with a monochromatic emission described by suitable adaptations of Standard Unbound profiles previously employed in the literature, we generate images of this solution, which displays relevant modifications to the typical photon ring and central brightness depression features found in black hole images. In this sense, we fit the width of the two first photon rings in order to reconstruct the Lyapunov exponent of nearly-bound geodesics characterizing the theoretical ratio of successive rings. Such an exponent is tightly attached to observational features of photon rings such as their relative intensities in time-averaged images and the time-scale of hot-spots. Our results point out that non-singular black holes of this type are hard to distinguish from their Schwarzschild counterparts using this method alone, since the theoretical, numerical, disk-modeling, and observational uncertainties are too entangled with one another to allowing a neat distinction of such an exponent. It also points out to the need of incorporating dynamical settings such as hot-spots or quasi-normal modes from gravitational wave ringdowns as a way to circumvent such difficulties."}

A substantial fraction of dEs are known to harbor central nuclei, which are among the densest stellar systems in the Universe. The large-scale distribution and the underlying origin of nucleated and non-nucleated dEs remain unresolved.

We find that nucleated dEs are more spatially clustered and exhibit a stronger association with massive galaxies than their non-nucleated counterparts. This suggests that most nucleated dEs likely formed alongside massive galaxies within the cluster (i.e, the in-situ formation). In contrast, non-nucleated dEs are more widely distributed across the cluster and align more closely with Virgo's global potential well, as traced by the cluster's hot gas. This indicates that most non-nucleated dEs originated outside the cluster (i.e, the ex-situ formation) and were later accreted and redistributed within it. Our findings shed new light on how dEs and their central nuclei form and evolve."}

The differential scattering cross section is computed using the partial wave method, with the forward divergence handled via the series reduction technique. For the first time, we systematically examine the influence of the black hole charge, electromagnetic interactions, and field mass on the equatorial cross section. Our results reveal that regardless of whether the electromagnetic interaction is present or not, the frame-dragging effect shifts the glory away from the exact backward direction and can place interference minima there, contrasting with the on-axis scattering case. The average scattered flux intensity at the medium to large scattering angles exhibits a large enhancement as the Lorentz attraction or field mass increases, particularly in the slowly rotating regime, with the enhancement being frequency-dependent. When superradiance occurs, we observe that the cross section in the prograde scattering angles ($\\sim 135^{\\circ} < φ< 270^{\\circ}$) increases as the black hole spin increases, due to enhanced prograde partial wave contributions. Meanwhile, the superradiant scattering cross section increases in all (except the forward) directions when the Lorentz force becomes more repulsive.

It exhibits exponential decaying tails which contrast to the Levy-like power law behaviour encountered without friction. Such a non-vanishing drift acts as a regulator for the conventional ``forward'' stochastic $δN$-formalism, which is otherwise ill-defined in the unbounded and flat potentials typical of plateau models of inflation. This setup therefore allows us to compare the curvature distribution derived from both approaches, reverse and forward in time. Up to similar exponential tails, we find quantitative differences. In particular, in the classical-like limit of very large drift, the tails become Gaussian but only in the time-reversed picture. As a toy model of eternal inflation, we finally discuss the case of negative drift in which inflation never ends for many field trajectories. The forward approach becomes pathological whereas the reverse formalism gives back a finite curvature distribution with always exponential tails. All these differences end up being related to the very definition of the background which is ambiguous when a classical trajectory does not exist."}

We adapt the MultiBeam Point-source Scanning (MBPS) strategy to extended targets by gating detections to generalized on-target windows (gOTWs), i.e. the time intervals when a beam main lobe intersects a buffered cluster mask, and by enforcing the deterministic multibeam illumination sequence as a geometry test. Dynamic spectra with frequency resolution about 7.5 Hz and time resolution about 10 s are searched with turboSETI over drift rates |nu_dot| <= 4 Hz s^-1 at signal-to-noise ratio S/N >= 10. From about 2.75e5 raw hits across both linear polarizations, none survive the gOTW gating, array-wide simultaneity veto, in-stripe ordering, and single-drift coherence checks, yielding a robust null result. With system equivalent flux density SEFD about 1.5 Jy and an effective 60 s per illuminated crossing, our per-crossing flux density threshold is S_min about 0.50 Jy, corresponding to minimum isotropic-equivalent radiated power EIRP_min in the range (0.72-1.8)e16 W for cluster distances 4-6.5 kpc; when multiple illuminated crossings occur, non-coherent stacking improves sensitivity by up to sqrt(N). To our knowledge this is the first FAST technosignature survey dedicated to globular clusters and the first to use MBPS as the primary observing strategy. These limits disfavor bright, persistent, isotropic L-band beacons above the stated thresholds during our epochs and establish a scalable blueprint, based on geometry-aware gating and verification, for multi-epoch MBPS campaigns that expand signal morphologies and combine passes to deepen constraints on transmitters in dense stellar systems."}

However, assuming General Relativity in the analysis of large-scale structure could introduce systematic biases if gravity deviates from GR at these scales. Modified gravity theories, such as the Hu-Sawicki formulation of $f(R)$ gravity, offer an alternative explanation for cosmic acceleration without invoking a cosmological constant, while remaining consistent with Solar System tests through screening mechanisms. In this work, we quantify the cosmological parameter biases that arise when using a combination of galaxy clustering and weak-lensing data-vectors, the so-called 3x2pt analysis, from an $f(R)$ galaxy mock under the incorrect assumption of GR, using for the first time high-fidelity full-sky galaxy mock catalogues. We employ a pair of twin simulations: one with GR and one with Hu--Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity with $|f_{R0}| = 10^{-5}$. The mocks are built using an HOD method to populate the dark matter haloes with galaxies, calibrated against SDSS observations at low redshift. Using conservative scale cuts to minimise modelling uncertainties, we perform 3x2pt analyses and infer cosmological parameters through nested sampling, validating our pipeline with the GR mock. Our results show that when analysing the $f(R)$ galaxy mock assuming GR, the recovered cosmological parameters are very significantly biased, even when considering conservative scale cuts: the Figure of Bias reaches $\\sim12σ$ for both $\\{Ω_{\\rm m}, σ_8\\}$ and $S_8$. These biases persist even when marginalising over the galaxy bias and baryonic feedback, demonstrating that nuisance parameters cannot absorb the effects of modified gravity.

We estimate the star formation rate (SFR) by combining the Galaxy Evolution Explorer near-ultraviolet and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer 12 $μ$m imaging data to examine the relationship between molecular gas and SFR densities on scales of several hundred parsecs. We find that the power-law slope of the molecular SFL ranges from 0.62 to 1.08, with an average value of N$=0.81\\pm0.18$, increasing to N$=0.87\\pm0.05$ when excluding galaxies with poorly constrained CO data. These results are roughly consistent with values observed in massive spiral galaxies, suggesting a universal molecular SFL when analyzed with sufficient resolution and sensitivity. Radial profiles of the Toomre $Q$ parameter remain close to unity across the disks, with minimal radial variation, consistent with a self-regulated star formation model. Our results suggest that, despite their lower mass and metallicity, star formation in dwarf galaxies is governed by the same fundamental physical processes as in larger systems. This highlights the significance of high-resolution molecular gas observations in low-mass galaxies."}

Specifically, we measure the conditional average density, defined as the average density of galaxies observed around a typical galaxy in the sample. To minimize boundary effects, we adopt a conservative criterion: only galaxies for which a spherical volume of radius $r$, centered on them, is fully contained within the survey footprint are included in the computation. For the BGS, we construct four volume-limited subsamples in order to eliminate biases arising from luminosity-dependent selection effects. By contrast, the LRGS is approximately volume-limited by design. The resulting samples span different depths, providing an opportunity to test the stability of statistical measurements across survey volumes of increasing size. Our results show that the conditional average density follows a power-law decay, $\\langle n(r) \\rangle \\propto r^{-0.8}$, without exhibiting any transition to homogeneity within the survey volume. The large statistics of the DESI samples also allow us to demonstrate that finite-size effects become significant as $r$ approaches the boundaries of the sample volumes. Consistently, we find that the distribution of density fluctuations follows a Gumbel distribution - characteristic of extreme-value statistics - rather than a Gaussian distribution, which would be expected for a spatially homogeneous field. These findings confirm and extend the trends previously observed in smaller redshift surveys, supporting the conclusion that the galaxy distribution does not undergo a transition to spatial homogeneity within the probed scales, up to $r \\sim 400$~\\text{Mpc}/$h$."}

Studying their abundances provides valuable insights into nucleosynthesis processes and the broader evolution of neutron-capture elements. We presented new observations of Mo and Ru, together with nearby neutron-capture elements strontium (Sr) and zirconium (Zr) for a new sample of 154 giant stars, located in the Galactic disk with metallicities -1 < [Fe/H] < +0.3. The abundances were determined under the assumption of the local thermodynamic equilibrium by fitting synthetic spectra. The abundances of Mo were derived from the Mo I lines at 5506 and 5533 A, the abundances of Ru were determined from Ru I lines at 4584, and 4757 A. For most of the giant stars observed in this work, Mo and Ru abundances were determined for the first time. We compare our observations with the signatures from different nucleosynthesis processes. Both the [Mo/Fe] and [Ru/Fe] in our stars show a decreasing trend with respect to increasing [Fe/H]. This pattern is similar to that of [Zr/Fe], whereas [Sr/Fe] exhibits a relatively flat trend with metallicity. Compared to the s-process ratios, all stars show a lower [Zr/Mo] and a higher [Ru/Mo], as expected from classical nucleosynthesis. Still, it is unclear if additional contributions from neutrino-wind components or the i-process is needed to explain the observed scatter of [Zr/Mo] and [Ru/Mo] in the Milky Way disk. Indeed, such a dispersion is consistent with the variations also seen in r-II stars at low metallicity and could therefore result from the combined contributions of r-process and s-process to galactic chemical evolution. The observed [Zr/Mo] and [Ru/Mo] scatter in r-II stars should be constrained by future investigations to define if any contributions of additional nucleosynthesis components are needed."}

EzTaoX achieves a speed increase of $\\sim 10^2-10^4 \\times$ on CPUs over current tools with similar capabilities, while maintaining equal or better accuracy in recovering simulated variability properties. This performance gain enables continuum time-delay measurements for all AGNs discovered by LSST -- both in the Wide Fast Deep survey and the Deep Drilling Fields -- thereby opening new opportunities to probe AGN accretion-flow geometries.

Collisions of galaxies may create an offset between the centers of mass of these two components. Ignoring internal dynamics of particles in the dark matter halo and Keplerian rotations of stars in the galaxy, we focus on possible relative oscillations of the visible matter in the dark matter halo. This two-fluid model is somewhat similar to the ``giant dipole resonances'' in nuclei. We estimate possible amplitude and frequency of such oscillations assuming that the offset of the centers of mass is small as compared with the size of the galaxy. Such oscillations, if exist, should manifest themselves in anomalies of velocities of stars in the galaxy, such as the density waves and runaway stars which have orbit periods in resonance with oscillations. These matter -- dark matter oscillations may affect direction and magnitude of the dark matter wind coming to Earth."}

Comments welcome. Resubmitted after review to PRD", "summary": "The tidal forces experienced on an orbit contain, in principle, information about the underlying spacetime an object is moving through. Astronomical observations often probe the properties of tidal forces in the relativistic regime, and could thus in principle be leveraged to examine the properties of strong-field gravity, provided that a general procedure for computing the relativistic tidal tensor is known. Existing techniques for deriving the tidal tensor rely on cumbersome, case-by-case methods. This paper introduces a unified analytical approach to deriving the tidal accelerations experienced by a test particle in any stationary, axisymmetric spacetime. This technique uses standard relativistic frame transformations and is built around the zero angular momentum observer frame. The method's utility is demonstrated in the four traditional black hole metrics: Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, Kerr, and Kerr-Newman, as well as a particular wormhole metric. As an example of a possible astronomical application of this work, we discuss the concept of the Hills mass, the maximum mass at which a black hole can disrupt a star, and extend its definition to various naked singularity metrics."}

However, observational measurements of this `burst mass fraction' are scant. Here, we assemble a large (~14,000) sample of post-coalescence galaxies that have recently completed their merger-induced star formation, and compare various measurements of central stellar mass with a matched control sample. Specifically, we quantify (at fixed redshift, star formation rate and total stellar mass) the stellar mass enhancement within a fixed angular aperture (Delta M_{star,fibre}) and in the galactic bulge (Delta M_{star,bulge}), finding burst mass fractions of 10 -- 20 %. 61 galaxies in our sample are at z<0.05 and have integral field unit data from the Mapping Galaxies at Apache Point (MaNGA) survey, allowing further kpc-scale assessment of excess stellar mass and radial gradients. Again, we find a ~15 -- 20 % excess of stellar mass in the central regions of the post-mergers compared with matched controls. However, contrary to previous works, which have inferred very compact, centralized merger-induced mass growth, we find a 15 % stellar mass excess out to ~7 kpc (1.4 R_e for the stellar masses in our sample). Our work represents the first direct measurement of merger-induced stellar mass that is independent of stellar population modelling, or fitting light profiles, demonstrating significant and extended mass build-up in late stage post-mergers."}

The key result is a fully explicit analytic expression for both the renormalized Newton constant and the corresponding correction to the entropy. Using the Euclidean action, the replica trick, and heat-kernel methods, we obtain a closed-form expression that depends directly on the horizon area, the scalar mass, the interaction strength, and the curvature coupling. The correction exhibits a characteristic logarithmically enhanced quadratic divergence, which is absorbed into the renormalized gravitational coupling. Once this renormalization is performed, the entropy takes the standard Bekenstein-Hawking form with a finite, physically meaningful value. Our result makes it possible to study in detail how the correction varies with model parameters: light fields and strong interactions increase the effect, curvature suppresses it, and conformally coupled fields show no leading-order contribution. Overall, this work provides a clear analytic demonstration of how quantum field interactions modify black hole entropy through the renormalization of Newton's constant."}

Interestingly, as a direct consequence of non-alignment of the electromagnetic field and contrary to the Plebański--Demiański class (where the field is aligned), such a symmetry no longer generates the full \"tower of symmetries\". Despite this, it enables one to separate variables in massless Hamilton--Jacobi, conformal wave, and massless Dirac equations, as well as allows one to tackle massless vector and tensor perturbations.

Our work also presents the first measurements of relevant non-minimal cosmological parameters from the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and DESI full-shape (FS) data, which are made possible thanks to carefully chosen priors on EFT parameters. We find that the addition the FS likelihood to DESI's baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data improves the limits on the spatial curvature by a factor of two over the BAO only results, though the improvements are less significant with the CMB data. The dark energy equation of state figure-of-merit increases both with and without the supernovae data (SNe), by $\\approx30\\%$ and $\\approx20\\%$ relative to the CMB+BAO and CMB+BAO+SNe results, respectively. Our FS likelihood also yields the strongest CMB-independent constraint on the total neutrino mass $M_ν<0.32\\,{\\rm eV}$, with the $30\\%$ improvement due to the bispectrum. In combination with the CMB, we find a $14\\%$ improvement assuming the $Λ$CDM+$M_ν$ model (yielding $M_ν<0.059\\,{\\rm eV}$), but this increases to $22\\%$ when using non-minimal backgrounds: $M_ν<0.097\\,{\\rm eV}$ in $oΛ$CDM+$M_ν$ and $M_ν<0.13\\,{\\rm eV}$ in $w_0w_a$CDM+$M_ν$.

Next-generation gravitational wave detectors such as ET, CE, and NEMO are expected to observe high-frequency gravitational wave signals, that is, the post-merger stage of the coalescence of binary neutron stars; then from these signals one can estimate the maximum mass that a spinless neutron star (MTOV) can have. In this paper, we investigate the problem of the determination of the MTOV precision from the post-merger detected by next-generation observatories. The results show that CE achieves the best mass precision with approximately 8% $M_{\\odot}$ for the maximum merger rate (250 Gpc-3yr-1). Therefore, based on the results obtained in this study, it will still be necessary to improve the sensitivity at high frequencies of future ground-based gravitational wave observatories if one wants to obtain greater precision in the MTOV estimation. One possibility would be to improve the sensitivity in a frequency range that allows us to determine whether or not a black hole was formed in the coalescence."}

We develop an analytic model of microlensing by EDOs embedded in a macrolensing cluster potential and derive the resulting caustics and light curves.

HERA Phase II constitutes several significant improvements in the signal chain compared to Phase I, most notably resulting in expanded frequency bandwidth, from 50-250 MHz. In these first upper limits, we investigate a small two-week subset of the available Phase II observations, with a focus on identifying new systematic characteristics of the instrument, and establishing an analysis pipeline to account for them. We report 2$σ$ upper limits in eight spectral bands, spanning $5.6 \\leq z \\leq 24.4$ that are consistent with thermal noise at the $2σ$ level for $k \\gtrsim 0.6-0.9 h{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ (band dependent). Our tightest limit during Cosmic Dawn ($z>12$) is $1.13\\times 10^6 {\\rm mK}^2$ at ($k=0.55 h{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}, z=16.78$), and during the EoR ($5.5<z<12$) it is $1.78\\times 10^3 {\\rm mK}^2$ at ($k=0.70 h{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}, z=7.05$). We find that mutual coupling has become our dominant systematic, leaking foreground power that strongly contaminates the low-$k$ modes, resulting in the loss of modes from $k=0.35-0.55$ compared to Phase I data."}

We recast the dark sector, cosmic acceleration, large-scale structure, and cosmic tensions as emergent consequences of nonlocal memory and intrinsically persistent organization in a self-gravitating Universe. By introducing a maximum-caliber weight on cosmic histories and a bias functional encoding structural memory, we derive modified Friedmann, Boltzmann, and Poisson equations that naturally generate dark energy-like acceleration, dark matter-like clustering, and scale-dependent growth suppression. We also show how this approach can naturally help alleviate the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, can produce anisotropic velocity fields, and predict environment-dependent halo signatures that cannot arise from particle dark matter or scalar-field dark energy. We also derive a generalized horizon entropy and temperature, revealing a nonequilibrium statistical origin for cosmic acceleration and formulating a Law of Universal Arbitrage Equilibrium that governs the evolution of the Universe, showing that it is expanding towards a continuous form of Nash equilibrium. Cosmological Teleodynamics therefore offers a unified, emergent, and testable alternative to the conventional dark sector, rooted not in new particles but in the intrinsic statistical and systemic structure of cosmic memory, and shows that the universe itself operates like a giant potential game."}

Constraints on Dark Energy, Spatial Curvature, and Neutrino Masses", "comment": "19 pages, 6 figures, 10 tables", "summary": "We carry out an independent re-analysis of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) public dataset, focusing on extensions to the standard cosmological model, $Λ$CDM. Utilizing the dataset and Effective Field Theory (EFT)-based pipeline described in Paper 1, we constrain cosmological models with massive neutrinos ($Λ$CDM+$M_ν$), spatial curvature ($oΛ$CDM), dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a$CDM), and their combinations using the power spectrum and bispectrum of DESI galaxies and quasars. Our work also presents the first measurements of relevant non-minimal cosmological parameters from the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and DESI full-shape (FS) data, which are made possible thanks to carefully chosen priors on EFT parameters. We find that the addition the FS likelihood to DESI's baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data improves the limits on the spatial curvature by a factor of two over the BAO only results, though the improvements are less significant with the CMB data. The dark energy equation of state figure-of-merit increases both with and without the supernovae data (SNe), by $\\approx30\\%$ and $\\approx20\\%$ relative to the CMB+BAO and CMB+BAO+SNe results, respectively. Our FS likelihood also yields the strongest CMB-independent constraint on the total neutrino mass $M_ν<0.32\\,{\\rm eV}$, with the $30\\%$ improvement due to the bispectrum. In combination with the CMB, we find a $14\\%$ improvement assuming the $Λ$CDM+$M_ν$ model (yielding $M_ν<0.059\\,{\\rm eV}$), but this increases to $22\\%$ when using non-minimal backgrounds: $M_ν<0.097\\,{\\rm eV}$ in $oΛ$CDM+$M_ν$ and $M_ν<0.13\\,{\\rm eV}$ in $w_0w_a$CDM+$M_ν$. Overall, our work illustrates that robust and substantial gains in constraining power can be obtained by incorporating the FS power spectrum and bispectrum measurements in analyses of non-minimal cosmological models."}

It exhibits exponential decaying tails which contrast to the Levy-like power law behaviour encountered without friction. Such a non-vanishing drift acts as a regulator for the conventional ``forward'' stochastic $δN$-formalism, which is otherwise ill-defined in the unbounded and flat potentials typical of plateau models of inflation. This setup therefore allows us to compare the curvature distribution derived from both approaches, reverse and forward in time. Up to similar exponential tails, we find quantitative differences. In particular, in the classical-like limit of very large drift, the tails become Gaussian but only in the time-reversed picture. As a toy model of eternal inflation, we finally discuss the case of negative drift in which inflation never ends for many field trajectories. The forward approach becomes pathological whereas the reverse formalism gives back a finite curvature distribution with always exponential tails. All these differences end up being related to the very definition of the background which is ambiguous when a classical trajectory does not exist."}
