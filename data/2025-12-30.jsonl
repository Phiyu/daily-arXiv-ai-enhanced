To reduce cross-dataset systematics, we define the green valley internally using $(g-r)$ percentiles: for galaxies with $\\log_{10}(M_\\star/M_\\odot)>10$, we select the 75th-95th percentiles (SDSS observed-frame fibre colours; simulations rest-frame synthetic colours within 30 kpc). SDSS hosts are linked to the MPA-JHU catalogue for stellar masses and aperture-corrected total SFRs. TNG green-valley centrals are almost entirely quenched, with a sharp pile-up at the imposed SFR floor and median $\\log_{10}\\mathrm{sSFR}\\simeq-14.85$ ($\\sim$3.5 dex below SDSS). EAGLE instead produces a broad, continuous distribution with median $\\log_{10}\\mathrm{sSFR}\\simeq-11.71$ and substantial overlap with SDSS, robust to varying the lower percentile between 60 and 90. At fixed mass, TNG yields higher green-valley occupancy fractions (reaching $\\gtrsim60$ per cent near $M_\\star\\sim10^{11}M_\\odot$) than EAGLE (20-40 per cent). A simple forward model of nebular line ratios places EAGLE analogues across the star-forming and composite loci in the BPT plane, while TNG analogues concentrate in a LINER-like, low-sSFR regime. We infer that TNG's kinetic mode drives an efficient, near-binary shutdown of star formation, whereas EAGLE's stochastic thermal feedback supports a slower decline more consistent with local AGN hosts.

Due to randomly triggered accretion events, the lifetime of the retriggered jet is not expected to have any connection to the time of quiescence between jets, yet we show that a correlation between the two quantities may exist, which we interpret as resulting from continued accretion through the quiescent jet phase. Despite continuous accretion, a jet is absent because its presence depends on a non-zero value of black hole spin, but accretion transitions the system from counter-rotation to corotation, and therefore through zero black hole spin where a jet cannot form. The time of jet quiescence depends on how long it takes to spin the black hole up again in corotation, which is longer for lower accretion rates. Once the black hole spin is large enough for a renewed jet, this inner jet will last longer the lower the accretion rate is. Hence, in a continuous accretion scenario, longer quiescent times tend to associate to longer inner jet times. In addition, DDRG jets are of FRII morphology which we show to result from the absence of a tilt in the accretion disk in the transition through zero black hole spin, ensuring the absence of an FRI jet in a way that connects with our understanding of X-shaped radio galaxies. Both correlated timescales as well as sameness in jet morphology offers evidence in favor of our picture."}

Obs. Skalnaté Pleso", "summary": "We present observational evidence supporting the presence of a stratified accretion disk wind in active galactic nuclei (AGN), based on multi-wavelength spectroscopic analysis of broad and narrow emission lines. The diversity in emission line profiles, ionization potentials, and kinematic signatures suggests a structured outflow emerging from the accretion disk, with different zones contributing to specific spectral features. High-ionization lines (e.g., Civ λ1549) exhibit strong blueshifts and asymmetric profiles indicative of fast, inner winds, while low-ionization lines (e.g., H\\b{eta}, Mgii λ 2800) show more symmetric profiles consistent with predominant emission from slower, denser regions farther out, although exhibiting systematic blueshifts in quasars radiating at high Eddington ratios. The intermediate ionization lines (e.g., Aliii λ1860) present a situation that is intermediate in terms of shift amplitudes, although in several super-Eddington candidates radial outflow velocity may reach values comparable to the ones of the high ionization lines. These results are consistent with radiatively driven wind models featuring radial stratification. We made preliminary photoionization modeling assuming unabsorbed radiation emitted from the corona and the hotter disk regions emission or absorbed by a layer of gas. Our findings provide new constraints on the geometry and physical conditions of AGN winds, providing clear evidence in favor of stratified wind emission."}

While morphological features such as tidal bridges have been visually identified in past surveys, our quantitative analysis using SDSS DR16 kinematical data reveals a significant radial velocity offset of approximately 8372 km/s. UGC 694 exhibits a heliocentric velocity of 12683 +/- 34 km/s, placing it at a distance of approximately 188 Mpc, whereas IC 412 is located in the foreground at approximately 62 Mpc with a velocity of 4311 +/- 46 km/s. This vast spatial separation of approximately 123.5 Mpc confirms that the perceived proximity is a line-of-sight projection effect rather than a physical gravitational encounter. Furthermore, we utilize differential photometry to analyze the structural asymmetry and color distribution of UGC 694. Our photometric findings suggest that the galaxy's disturbed morphology is not a result of a tidal encounter with IC 412, but likely originates from internal evolutionary processes or minor mergers with undetected companions. This work emphasizes the critical role of multi-wavelength validation in classifying interacting systems to avoid misinterpretation due to projection effects."}

Stacking analyses coadd cutouts of LIM data on positions of known signal emitters, robustly detecting signal otherwise hidden in a noisy map. In this article, we present two augmentations of a stacking pipeline, both aiming to refine the sensitivity of the stack by assuming a specific observed signal shape in 2D spatial axes or 3D spatial and spectral axes, as well as stacking on source coordinates more precise than the resolution of the LIM data cube. We test these methods on a series of simplistic and complex simulations mimicking observations with the CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder. We find that these fitting methods provide up to a 25% advantage in detection significance over the original stack method in realistic COMAP-like simulations. We also find that the optimal fitting profile, given our CO line model and galaxy model, is larger than the 5' width of the COMAP beam and takes on a Lorentzian shape in the spectral dimension. Our findings suggest a nuanced dependence of the optimal profile size and shape on the LIM signal itself, including redshift-space clustering and fingers-of-God effects that depend on the tracer luminosity function and bias."}

In this work, we investigate the impact of spherically symmetric dark-matter distributions on black hole geometry, geodesic structure, and ringdown phenomenology. Modeling the surrounding matter through Einstein clusters, we construct self-consistent spacetimes for three widely used density profiles - the Hernquist, Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), and Jaffe models - and examine how their near-horizon behavior modifies the location and stability of circular timelike and null geodesics, including the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and light rings. In the low-compactness regime, we derive analytical expressions showing that environmental effects generically shift the ISCO inward and the principal light ring outward, leading to parametric deviations in their associated orbital frequencies and Lyapunov exponents. At higher compactness, we explore the emergence of additional light rings, marginally stable orbits, and secondary horizons, identifying the regions of parameter space in which these ultracompact configurations arise. Using time-domain evolutions of scalar perturbations, we demonstrate how such structures can imprint characteristic signatures on the ringdown signal, including long-lived trapped modes and echo-like modulations associated with multiple potential barriers. Our results provide a unified framework for assessing environmental effects around black holes and highlight the importance of matter-induced corrections for interpreting upcoming electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations."}

Using two recent large LAMOST catalogues of field, low-mass giant stars (both Li-rich and Li-poor) with metallicities from -4.0 to -1.0, we studied the conditions for Li enrichment and the distribution of stellar rotations in the Galactic halo and thick disc. Due to the scarcity of stars with [Fe/H] < -3.0, only three Li-rich RGB stars are known in this regime. The observational appearance of giants across the horizontal branch (HB) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stages (with Li abundances up to 6.15 dex) has been detected for metallicities > -2.5. Among these stars, we detected IR excesses indicative of giant stars losing mass, showing a recent episodic Li-enrichment process related to the Cameron-Fowler mechanism for the formation of new 7Li. Because stars with IR excesses are distributed across most metallicity values, we suggest this mechanism is at work throughout an important part of the Galaxy's evolutionary history. Based on these IR excesses, we identified three Li thresholds: about 1.5 dex for RGB stars, about 0.5 dex for HB stars, and about -0.5 dex for AGB stars, establishing a new criterion to characterise Li-rich giants. We carried out a study of stellar rotations in metal-poor giant stars, revealing that a plateau appears for velocities greater than 40 km/s up to near 90 km/s, with Li abundances from 1.02 to 1.82 dex. Among Li-rich giants with v sin i > 40 km/s, increasing rotation is observed as metallicity decreases from -1.0 to -2.5. The presence of RGB and HB Li-rich giants with rotations up to 90 km/s suggests that stellar models must account for extended 3He reservoir lifetimes as a source of 7Li. The velocity around 40 km/s appears to be a new critical value."}

However, the signal is extremely faint and contaminated by gravitational lensing, instrumental noise, and astrophysical foregrounds. Here we present a score-based diffusion approach, formulated using variance-exploding stochastic differential equations (VE-SDEs), to reconstruct the primordial B-mode angular power spectrum from contaminated observations. The method employs a reverse SDE guided by a score model trained exclusively on random realizations of the primordial low $\\ell$ B-mode angular power spectrum corresponding to a fixed tensor-to-scalar ratio $r=0.001$. During inference, the reverse SDE iteratively drives the observed angular power spectrum toward the learned primordial manifold, effectively denoising and delensing the input. The model is tested on simulated observational spectra that include gravitational lensing, complex polarized foreground combinations, and instrumental noise characteristics representative of the proposed ECHO mission. The trained score model learns the underlying statistical distribution of the primordial B-mode field for the given $r$, which acts as a physics-guided prior that can generate new, consistent realizations of the signal. This approach provides a robust framework for primordial signal recovery in future CMB polarization missions."}

By numerically solving the scalar-field equation with a double-well potential, we show that the wormhole throat parameter $a$ has a strong impact on the dynamics of the radial kink: larger $a$ leads to wider throats and allows the domain wall to oscillate across the throat with large amplitude, whereas smaller $a$ confines the motion nearby the throat. In addition, each time the kink crosses the wormhole throat, it emits scalar wave packets, causing its oscillation amplitude to gradually decrease. Our results reveal how the wormhole geometry influences the motion of defects and their energy transfer, providing new insights into the dynamics of topological defects in exotic spacetime."}

In our study, we adopt the Higgs hybrid metric-Palatini model as our framework, in which the inflaton field and the Palatini curvature are non-minimally coupled. To achieve our objective, we analyze the behavior of the primordial curvature power spectrum, which exhibits a large enhancement at small scales corresponding to large wavenumbers $k$. Furthermore, we examine the probability of PBHs formation by studying the mass variance, $σ(M_{PBH})$, and the mass fraction of the total energy density collapsing into PBHs, $β(M_{PBH})$. The evolution of both functions is consistent with current observational constraints. Finally, we investigate the abundance of primordial black holes as a dark matter candidate. We found that they can account for the totality or a fraction of the current dark matter content, depending primarily on the values of the coupling constant and the e-folds number."}

We focus on the first stars and use stellar evolution simulations to track down how DM capture evolves over time from the zero-age main sequence to the late metal-rich stages of stellar evolution. During the early hydrogen-helium-dominated phase, the capture process is well described by scattering with two targets. As a star evolves, metal production leads to the formation of a dense core surrounded by a lighter envelope. The core significantly enhances the capture of ultra-heavy DM; in this case, three distinct nuclear species are required to accurately describe multiple-scattering capture. We use the Eddington inversion method to obtain a realistic DM velocity distribution, better suited when the star is near the center of a halo, than the widely used Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. We find that heavy DM would be able to thermalize and achieve capture-annihilation equilibrium within a massive star's lifetime for regions of the parameter space not excluded by direct detection. For non-annihilating DM, because of the high amount of targets available for capture and despite massive stars being short-lived, it would even be possible for DM to achieve self-gravitation and collapse to a black hole, which eventually could swallow the star from within before the expected end of the star's life, for non-excluded regions of the parameter space. Our results highlight the dependence of DM capture on the stellar evolutionary stage, composition, and halo location, demonstrating that accurate modeling of massive stars is essential for constraining heavy DM with primordial stellar populations."}

To overcome the single channel dominance degeneracy in high dimensional parameter scans, two classes of structural priors are introduced into the objective function: a \\texttt{mixing} prior to suppress extreme channel fractions and an \\texttt{entropy} prior to favor multi channel coexistence. Furthermore, the adoption of a layered warmness criterion (e.g., $Q \\equiv Υ/3H$) decouples model selection from cosmological observables, thereby enhancing analytical transparency.

This connection suggests that ghost-like configurations may find a natural realization within wormhole physics. In this work, we investigate the existence of ghost configurations by analyzing their associated Hawking mass. Although in spherical symmetry the Misner and Hawking masses are known to coincide, we show that when the ghost condition is extended beyond spherical symmetry and applied to the Hawking mass, it faces topological obstructions that hinder its straightforward realization.

The model reproduced quite well both the inner rise and outer flat regions of the observed rotation curves using the observed baryonic mass profiles only. The $K$ values for the 91 galaxies were found to be concentrated within a narrow range. These results suggest that dark matter is directly connected to the baryonic gravitational potential. A theoretical interpretation of the empirical law is also discussed, in which a relation between the additional energy and the cosmological constant is implied."}

We conduct a systematic search for quasars behind the Galactic plane using X-ray sources from the Chandra Source Catalog (CSC 2.1), combined with optical data from Gaia DR3 and mid-infrared data from CatWISE2020. Using spectroscopically confirmed quasars and stars from data sets including DESI, SDSS, and LAMOST, we apply a Random Forest classifier to identify quasar candidates, with stellar contaminants suppressed using Gaia proper-motion constraints. Photometric redshifts are estimated for the candidates using a Random Forest regression model. Applying this framework to previously unclassified CSC sources, we identify 6286 quasar candidates, including 863 Galactic Plane Quasar (GPQ) candidates at |b|<20°, of which 514 are high-confidence candidates. Relative to the previously known GPQ sample, our selected GPQs reach fainter optical and X-ray fluxes, improving sensitivity to low-flux GPQs. In addition, both the GPQ candidates and known GPQs display harder X-ray spectra than the all-sky quasar sample, consistent with increased absorption through the Galactic plane. Pilot spectroscopy confirms two high-confidence GPQ candidates as quasars at spectroscopic redshifts of z=1.2582 and z=1.1313, and further spectroscopic follow-up of the GPQ sample is underway. This work substantially improves the census of GPQs and provides a valuable target sample for future spectroscopic follow-up, enabling the use of GPQs to refine the reference frames for astrometry and probe the Milky Way interstellar and circumgalactic media with the absorption features of GPQs."}

We focus on the first stars and use stellar evolution simulations to track down how DM capture evolves over time from the zero-age main sequence to the late metal-rich stages of stellar evolution. During the early hydrogen-helium-dominated phase, the capture process is well described by scattering with two targets. As a star evolves, metal production leads to the formation of a dense core surrounded by a lighter envelope. The core significantly enhances the capture of ultra-heavy DM; in this case, three distinct nuclear species are required to accurately describe multiple-scattering capture. We use the Eddington inversion method to obtain a realistic DM velocity distribution, better suited when the star is near the center of a halo, than the widely used Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. We find that heavy DM would be able to thermalize and achieve capture-annihilation equilibrium within a massive star's lifetime for regions of the parameter space not excluded by direct detection. For non-annihilating DM, because of the high amount of targets available for capture and despite massive stars being short-lived, it would even be possible for DM to achieve self-gravitation and collapse to a black hole, which eventually could swallow the star from within before the expected end of the star's life, for non-excluded regions of the parameter space. Our results highlight the dependence of DM capture on the stellar evolutionary stage, composition, and halo location, demonstrating that accurate modeling of massive stars is essential for constraining heavy DM with primordial stellar populations."}

When the scalar potential vanishes, scalar-hairy black holes emerge with profiles and properties similar to those observed in flat spacetime. The presence of the scalar potential additionally induces tachyonic-hairy solutions, leading to the coexistence of these two distinct hairy phases in different regions of the parameter space. The phase diagram reveals a first-order phase transition line between the tachyonic-hairy and scalar-hairy phases, originating at a critical point in the extreme temperature and chemical potential regime. Our detailed analysis shows that this phase transition is directly associated with the self-overlap region of the scalar-hairy phase and its start point.

Using high-precision photometry and parallaxes from $Gaia$, we identify a significant anti-correlation between the $G$-band extinction coefficient and reddening for Galactic Cepheids, quantified as $R_G = 1.921 \\pm 0.060 - (0.107 \\pm 0.022)\\,E(G_{\\mathrm{BP}} - G_{\\mathrm{RP}})$. We propose that this anti-correlation is partly driven by the pronounced non-linear effects inherent to the broad $Gaia$ bands, while the remaining part arise from the $R_V$ variations caused by diverse interstellar medium. Adopting a fixed $R_G$ would not only lead to an overestimation of the metallicity dependence of Cepheid luminosities, but also systematically underestimate the distances to highly reddened Cepheids. Moreover, the strong reddening dependence of $R_G$ makes Wesenheit function based on it unsuitable for highly reddened Cepheids, since the definition of Wesenheit magnitudes requires a fixed extinction coefficient. In contrast, infrared-based distances, being less affected by non-linear effects and insensitive to $R_V$, provide the most reliable Cepheid distances at present. This work emphasizes the importance of accurately determining $R_V$ for Galactic Cepheids and accounting for non-linear effects in distance measurements, particularly in the optical bands."}

We identify several regions with broad SiO emission clearly associated with outflows, pinpointing the locations of ongoing star formation across the cloud. The ALMA images also reveal a series of spatially extended SiO emission spots with narrow line profiles, aligned along an arc-like path that is also seen in CS and CH3OH emission. While the broad SiO emission is mainly associated with the main cloud filament, as seen in visual extinction, the narrow SiO arch is located at the edge of the cloud, far from the identified sites of star formation activity. The presence of these arc-like morphologies suggests that large-scale shocks may have compressed the gas in the surroundings of the G035.39-00.33 cloud, shaping its filamentary structure. By inspecting the large-scale radio continuum emission around G035.39-00.33, we find that this IRDC is part of a larger star-forming complex where the densest and coolest material appears at the interacting regions between a Supernova Remnant (SNR) and an expanding HII region. In particular, we hypothesize that this IRDC may be spatially coincident with the ionized expanding gas associated with the previously identified SNR G35.6-0.4.

After a general introduction to the theory of general relativity and its major implications, the article discusses the history of gravitational waves, from their prediction by Einstein to their actual detection. It then explains what gravitational waves are and how they interact with appropriate detectors. The main mechanisms of gravitational radiation emission are analyzed, with a focus on compact binary systems of compact objects, whose orbits typically evolve in three phases: inspiral, merger, and the final ringdown phase, each of these phases leaving distinct signatures in the emitted waves. The article highlights the fundamental role of the giant interferometers LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, true cathedrals of modern science, and revisits the historic event GW150914, the first direct detection of gravitational waves, which confirmed the predictions of general relativity and opened a new era for astronomy. This achievement was recognized with the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Other observed events are also discussed, along with their astrophysical sources, and the possibility of detecting gravitational waves of cosmological origin, originating from the Big Bang itself. Finally, current and future projects are analyzed, including observatories based on increasingly sophisticated interferometers, as well as proposals for alternative detection methods, illustrating how gravitational-wave astronomy is shaping the present and future of our exploration of the universe. In concluding, the detection of gravitational waves is set in a broader context by examining the discoveries across the electromagnetic spectrum, thereby illustrating the complementary perspectives these different observational channels provide."}

In this work, we investigate the impact of spherically symmetric dark-matter distributions on black hole geometry, geodesic structure, and ringdown phenomenology. Modeling the surrounding matter through Einstein clusters, we construct self-consistent spacetimes for three widely used density profiles - the Hernquist, Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), and Jaffe models - and examine how their near-horizon behavior modifies the location and stability of circular timelike and null geodesics, including the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and light rings. In the low-compactness regime, we derive analytical expressions showing that environmental effects generically shift the ISCO inward and the principal light ring outward, leading to parametric deviations in their associated orbital frequencies and Lyapunov exponents. At higher compactness, we explore the emergence of additional light rings, marginally stable orbits, and secondary horizons, identifying the regions of parameter space in which these ultracompact configurations arise. Using time-domain evolutions of scalar perturbations, we demonstrate how such structures can imprint characteristic signatures on the ringdown signal, including long-lived trapped modes and echo-like modulations associated with multiple potential barriers. Our results provide a unified framework for assessing environmental effects around black holes and highlight the importance of matter-induced corrections for interpreting upcoming electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations."}

Our method provides a large class of exterior solutions of the constraint equations that can be matched to given interior solutions, according to the existing gluing techniques. As such, it can be applied to provide a large class of initial Cauchy data sets evolving to black holes, generalizing the well-known result of the formation of trapped surfaces due to Li and Yu.

It can, in particular, be easily adapted to construct arbitrarily fast decaying data. We expect, moreover, that our method can also be applied to construct data with slower decay, such as that used by Shen.

The deformation parameter $η$ allows the spin parameter to extend beyond the bounds imposed by the standard Kerr black hole. The results indicate that the polarized images depend not only on the magnetic field configuration, fluid velocity, and observer inclination angle, but also on the deformation parameter and the spin parameter. As the deformation parameter increases, the polarization intensity decreases monotonically when the magnetic field lies in the equatorial plane, whereas it does not vary monotonically when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the equatorial plane. The variation of the electric vector position angle with the deformation parameter is complex. For a fixed deformation parameter, the polarization intensity exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the spin parameter and varies with azimuthal angle.

We show that the microstructure is characterized by a discrete topological index, which encodes both horizon structure and thermodynamic stability. Non extremal Kerr Newman black holes with both inner and outer horizons correspond to a vanishing topological index, while single horizon configurations correspond to a positive unit topological index.

If either of these arguments holds, the first detection of continuous gravitational waves is likely with near future upgrades of current detectors, and many detections are likely with next generation detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. A lack of detections in the next several years would begin to raise serious doubts about current theories of millisecond pulsar formation."}

The Klein Gordon equation separates and yields a Schrödinger type radial equation with a single, smooth potential barrier shaped by the localized frame dragging profile of the wormhole throat. This barrier supports damped oscillatory modes across the full spin range examined. The resulting QNM spectrum exhibits a coherent and monotonic dependence on rotation. As the spin increases, both the oscillation frequency and the damping rate decrease, indicating progressively longer-lived modes in the absence of horizon induced absorption. In the eikonal limit, we extract the photon-ring radius, orbital frequency, and Lyapunov exponent, and verify the standard QNM-Eikonal correspondence. Comparison with Kerr black holes reveals qualitative differences. Whereas Kerr QNMs are governed by horizon absorption and exhibit symmetric prograde/retrograde mode splitting, the Teo wormhole displays a stronger but spatially confined spin response, partial reflection at the throat, and a distinctive one-sided splitting that saturates rapidly with increasing spin. Although the rotating Teo wormhole admits an ergoregion and superradiant compatible frequency kinematics, the absence of an event horizon or dissipative boundary prevents classical superradiant amplification. These results demonstrate how rotation and boundary conditions jointly shape wave propagation in horizonless compact objects and provide characteristic spectral signatures distinguishing rotating wormholes from Kerr black holes."}

We investigate the LTABH spacetime geometry, showing that the roots of the metric function determine a partition of the spacetime into four regions, depending on the acoustic parameter $ξ$ (whereas the dependence vanishes for the rotation parameter $a$); on the other hand, the parameter $a$ turns out to affect the critical radii associated to the maxima of the effective potential. All in all, both the acoustic sphere radius $r_{as}$ and the photon sphere radius $r_{ps}$, respectively giving rise to the acoustic shadow $R_{as}$ and to the optical shadow $R_{s}$, depend on $ξ$ and $a$. More precisely, the rotation parameter $a$ is more relevantly affecting $R_{s}$ (through a right shift), while $R_{as}$ retains its circular shape. For what concerns the acoustic parameter, we notice that the higher $ξ$ is, the larger the size of both shadows. All of these results are confirmed through a detailed analysis of the distortions and of the shadows radii. Moreover, by deriving the magnitude of the precession frequency $Ω$, we observe that it significantly increases near the acoustic horizons, both in the extremal and in the non-extremal cases, which implies that the Lense-Thirring (frame dragging) effect, which can be traced back to $ξ$ itself, becomes important near such regions. On the other hand, we also show that there are regions of the LTABH spacetime in which $% Ω$ vanishes, suggesting that therein possible probe particles would not be affected by the frame dragging at all. Finally, we derive the deflection of the light near the LTABH."}

We have used the more complete Wetterich equation, which includes gravitational couplings in a systematic way from the start, to understand the emergence of this phase.

As the modification parameter $α$ increases, neutron stars grow in both radius and mass. We find that, when the parameter $α$ is sufficiently large, a frozen state emerges at the end of the neutron-star sequence. In this state, the metric functions approach zero extremely close to the stellar surface, forming a critical horizon, making it nearly indistinguishable from a black hole to an external observer.

Consequently, the gravitational dynamics of the Kerr black hole in its point-particle effective theory is completely constrained in the self-dual sector for a hidden symmetry, implying the spin exponentiation of same-helicity gravitational Compton amplitudes to all multiplicities."}

The collapse of significant density perturbations originating from large primordial scalar fluctuations generated during inflation can lead to the formation of primordial black holes. In our study, we adopt the Higgs hybrid metric-Palatini model as our framework, in which the inflaton field and the Palatini curvature are non-minimally coupled. To achieve our objective, we analyze the behavior of the primordial curvature power spectrum, which exhibits a large enhancement at small scales corresponding to large wavenumbers $k$. Furthermore, we examine the probability of PBHs formation by studying the mass variance, $σ(M_{PBH})$, and the mass fraction of the total energy density collapsing into PBHs, $β(M_{PBH})$. The evolution of both functions is consistent with current observational constraints. Finally, we investigate the abundance of primordial black holes as a dark matter candidate. We found that they can account for the totality or a fraction of the current dark matter content, depending primarily on the values of the coupling constant and the e-folds number."}
