Model I, based on radiatively corrected Higgs inflation,\nsatisfies the FRDSSC and remains consistent with current observational\nconstraints ($n_s = 0.9743 \\pm 0.0034$, $r < 0.038$), but fails to meet the\nSWGC and SSWGC requirements, indicating limited theoretical compatibility with\nquantum gravity principles.

Our\nsimulations reveal that AGN feedback increases global star formation rates by\napproximately 25% when comparing our models with both AGN and supernova\nfeedback to those with only supernova feedback. This enhancement occurs through\nAGN-driven outflows creating compressed gas regions where efficient cooling\npreserves the high density while quickly radiating away thermal energy,\ncreating ideal conditions for star formation. This positive feedback mechanism\noperates in gas-rich starburst environments with efficient cooling and moderate\nAGN energy input that compresses gas without expelling it from the galaxy.\nCritically, it requires both AGN and supernova feedback working in concert:\nwithout SN feedback to regulate black hole activity, AGN outflows become too\npowerful and expel gas rather than compress it.

Although dust is\ngenerally assumed to represent $1 \\%$ of the gas mass, dust density variations\nare expected on small scales due to differential dynamics with the gas, leading\nto enhanced coagulation rates in regions of dust enrichment. Aims: We aim to\ninvestigate the clumping of charged dust in the turbulent magnetized dense\nregions of the interstellar medium. Methods: We develop a dusty model that goes\nbeyond the standard non-ideal MHD and use the code {\\ttfamily shark} to perform\nmultifluid 1D simulations of a single size charged dust species and neutral gas\nwith large scale driven turbulence and including ion-neutral friction. Results:\nWe identify a mechanism similar to the parametric instability that efficiently\nforms dust clumps even in presence of dissipative processes. Such strong\nclumping survives and is sustained when driving turbulence, and thus high\nlevels of dust concentration are produced due to compressive magnetic effects\nin regions of shocks. Dust density enhancements are favored by a high\ntransverse-to-longitudinal magnetic ratio which is controlled by: transverse\nMach number and plasma parameter. We find that a substantial fraction of dust\nexperiences a density increase of more than a factor of 10 under reasonable\nconditions, thus promoting dust growth. Conclusion: Our novel dusty non-ideal\nMHD model shows that dust grains (main charge carriers) are subject to\nsmall-scale compressive magnetic effects driven by a parametric instability -\nlike mechanism in regions of shocks, and consequently experience high density\nenhancements in turbulent environments that go beyond those permitted by pure\nhydrodynamical processes, making in-situ formation of large grains (sub-mm) in\nprotostellar envelopes a plausible scenario."}

This\nresearch has revealed intriguing similarities between the regularization\nmechanisms used in black hole models and those employed in quantum field\ntheory, such as the introduction of exponential suppression or energy cutoffs.\nWe propose a systematic exponential cutoff regularization scheme for static,\nspherically symmetric black hole solutions in general relativity. The method\nexplored in this paper serves as an alternative to the black-bounce singularity\nsuppression mechanism proposed by Simpson and Visser, which involves a\ncoordinate remapping $r \\rightarrow\\sqrt{r^2+a^2}$, as well as to the mechanism\nproposed by Bronnikov, which employs a Bardeen-type remapping in the metric.\nThe method presented here introduces exponential factors in the mass function,\nsmoothing curvature divergences and ensuring geodesic completeness under\nspecific conditions. This approach allows the regularization of known singular\nspacetimes without altering their asymptotic structure. We analyze curvature\ninvariants, horizon formation, and thermodynamic properties, showing that the\nregularized geometries avoid singularities while maintaining physical\nconsistency. As examples of application, we regularize the Schwarzschild black\nhole and present a novel regularized Kiselev solution.

We consider two accretion disk models:\nthe phenomenological model and the HOU disk model, where the phenomenological\nmodel includes both isotropic and anisotropic radiation. In all models, the\nexternal bright rings corresponding to the high-order image and the internal\ndark region associated with the event horizon are observed. At high\nobservational inclinations, the inner shadows are obscured by the radiation\nfrom the equatorial plane, which is significantly different from the thin\naccretion disk model. The primary distinction between isotropic and anisotropic\nradiation is that the latter causes distortion of the high-order image in the\nvertical direction, resulting in an elliptical structure. For the HOU disk\nmodel, due to certain regions are geometrically thinner under the conical\napproximation, the high-order images are narrower compared to the\nphenomenological model. Furthermore, we find that an increase in the rotational\nparameter $a$ leads to an asymmetry in the intensity distribution of the\nhigh-order image, while an increase in the spontaneous Lorentz violating\nparameters, $\\varsigma$ and $\\varpi$, results in a decrease in the size of the\nhigh-order image.

Nevertheless, double radio relics\ntend to align with the collision axis within $\\sim30^{\\circ}$ and their\nseparation ($d_{\\rm drr}$) correlates tightly with the time since collision\n(TSC) as ${\\rm TSC~[Gyr]} = 0.52 d_{\\rm drr}/R_{500\\rm c} - 0.24$, allowing it\nto be inferred with an accuracy of $\\sim0.2~\\rm Gyr$. With the statistical\nsamples of simulated radio relics, we predict that low-mass clusters will\nconstitute the dominant population of double radio relic systems detected with\nupcoming surveys such as SKA. These results demonstrate that double radio\nrelics can serve as robust probes of merger dynamics and plasma acceleration,\nand that simulations provide critical guidance for interpreting the large\nsamples expected from next-generation radio surveys."}

While prior studies suggest that CRs influence the thermal and\ndynamical state of the CGM, their role in shaping cold gas structures remains\nunderexplored. This paper investigates how CRs affect ram-pressure stripped\ncold gas clouds originating from satellite galaxies in a Milky Way-like halo.\nUsing high-resolution simulations with varying CR energy densities, we find\nthat CRs can significantly modify the size and survival of stripped clouds.\nSpecifically, CR pressure puffs up the cold clouds, increasing their surface\narea and enabling more efficient mixing-layer cooling, allowing them to grow in\nmass. This enhanced growth results in higher cold gas inflow rates into the\ncentral galaxy, leading to an increase in the star formation rate compared to\nthe no-CR case at a later time. Moreover, CRs can boost the total cold gas mass\nin the CGM by up to a factor of four. These effects are most pronounced in\nsimulations where the CR energy density is in equipartition with the thermal\ngas. Our results demonstrate that CRs can play a critical role in regulating\nthe cold phase of the CGM contributed by satellites and therefore their ability\nto feed galaxies."}

We apply this methodology to\nfour isolated, gas-rich Local Group dwarf galaxies -- WLM, Aquarius, Leo A, and\nLeo P -- using deep HST and JWST imaging. For WLM, Aquarius, and Leo A, we\nindependently validate our metallicity evolution results using ages and\nmetallicities of individual red giant stars with spectroscopic measurements,\nfinding good agreement. We quantify systematic uncertainties by repeating our\nanalysis with multiple stellar evolution and bolometric correction libraries.\nWe then compare the observed chemical enrichment histories to predictions from\nthe TNG50 and FIREbox cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and the Galacticus\nsemi-analytic model. We find that the enrichment history of WLM is best\nreproduced by the FIREbox simulation, while TNG50 and Galacticus predict higher\nmetallicities at early times. Our results suggest that differences in stellar\nfeedback and metal recycling prescriptions drive significant variation in the\npredicted chemical enrichment of dwarf galaxies, particularly at early times.\nThis work demonstrates the power of combining resolved SFHs with physically\nmotivated chemical evolution models to constrain galaxy formation physics and\nhighlights the need for further observational and theoretical studies of metal\nretention and recycling in low-mass dwarf galaxies."}
