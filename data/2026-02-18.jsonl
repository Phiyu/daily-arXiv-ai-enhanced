Because these features are extremely faint, alternative tracers such as globular clusters (GCs) provide a powerful tool to study cluster assembly. We use deep VLT/FORS $V$- and $I$-band imaging to investigate the GC population in the nearby Hydra I galaxy cluster ($\\sim 45.7$ Mpc). GC candidates were selected from the $VI$ colour-magnitude diagram and divided into blue and red subpopulations. We find a clear spatial dichotomy: red GCs are concentrated around the massive central galaxies NGC 3311 and NGC 3309, while blue GCs are more extended and offset from the centre, coinciding with a secondary peak of X-ray-emitting gas. In the central regions, GC spatial distributions further depend on stellar population properties: young metal-rich GCs are more extended and may be linked to ram-pressure stripping, whereas old metal-poor GCs are more centrally concentrated, possibly originating from disrupted dwarf galaxies. Comparing the GC number density profiles to the surface brightness profile of NGC 3311, we find that the red GCs closely follow the galaxy light, while the blue population significantly deviates from it and traces the global gravitational potential of the cluster. This is also reflected in the specific frequency of blue GCs, which is approximately $\\sim 5\\times$ higher in the ICL-dominated outskirts than in the inner regions dominated by red GCs. Finally, we present a novel method to constrain the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function of the cluster using GC specific frequencies and colour distributions, yielding a past faint-end slope of $α=-1.81^{+0.16}_{-0.16}$ compared to $α=-1.41^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$ today, consistent with high-redshift observations and cosmological simulations."}

We also construct models which generate such NMOs as solutions within the two-scalar theory and scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity inspired by string theory. The orbits of the photon and massive particles are investigated in the background, where there is a negative mass object which realises a kind of effective anti-gravity. It is explicitly found that the bound system consisting of a positive mass object and a negative mass object can be formed in spite that a positive mass object suffers the repulsive force from the NMO. The possibility that such exotic objects might be observed is discussed. A simple conjecture about their possible masses is made, too. As an even more exotic object, we consider a non-trivial object with vanishing mass and investigate its properties."}

Using angular-size constraints for SgrA* and M87* from the Event Horizon Telescope and the GRAVITY collaboration, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to infer the admissible parameter ranges of the model and to quantify degeneracies among the black-hole mass and nonlinear-electrodynimcs parameters.

Our analysis emphasises the phenomenological implications of the model through a combination of analytical and numerical investigations, with particular attention to singularity resolution and the formation of trapped surfaces. As in symmetric bounce models, the central curvature singularity inside the collapsing dust cloud is resolved. However, in contrast to the symmetric case, we find that a singularity emerges in the polymerised vacuum region during the bounce phase. This singularity can be identified as a shell-crossing singularity and exhibits the expected power-law behaviour of curvature scalars. Furthermore, likewise to the symmetric bounce models, we find a critical mass threshold governing the formation of inner and outer horizons in the pre-bounce phase. No analogous critical mass restriction arises for the formation of the inner horizon in the post-bounce phase, highlighting a qualitative difference between the pre- and post-bounce dynamics."}

With the aim to generate synthetic empirical data for fine-tuning LSS classification algorithms, as well as to train machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL) models for the same purpose, this work presents a purely geometrical simulation based on statistical spatial properties found in LSS surveys, using the spectroscopic main galaxy sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) catalogue up to a redshift of z~0.1 as a specific use case. A parallelism between the LSS and the Voronoi tessellation was utilised, in which the nodes, links, surfaces, and cells of the diagram correspond to clusters, filaments, walls, and voids, respectively. The simulation used random positions within voids as seeds for tessellating the 3D space. The resulting structures were randomly populated with galaxies that adhere to the statistical properties of their observational respective structures. As the galaxies were generated, they were tagged with their corresponding structure. In each simulation, six LSS mock catalogues were generated, following the statistical behaviour observed in the SDSS catalogue, depending on the structure they belong to. The Malmquist bias and the Fingers of God effect were simulated as well. We present a novel geometrical LSS simulator, where generated galaxies mimic the statistical properties of their observational belonging structure. The simulator was tuned to mimic the SDSS catalogue, although any other catalogue can be considered. With the generated catalogue, it is possible to adjust the LSS classification algorithms, train and test ML/DL models, and benchmark several LSS classification methods using this pre-labelled data to contrast their results and performance."}

We show that such exact solutions split into two main subclasses that (after a suitable re-parametrization) can be interpreted as either the uncharged Schwarzschild or C-metric in the external Bertotti-Robinson (BR) spacetime with geometry ${\\mathrm{AdS}_2\\times\\mathrm{S}_2}$, or as the charged Reissner-Nordstrom black hole accelerating in the external BR electromagnetic field. The distinction between these two subclasses is determined by the parameter $r_0$ that encodes relations between the external Maxwell field (given by the non-aligned components of the Faraday tensor ${Φ_0=Φ_2}$) and the Maxwell field created by the charge of the black hole (given by the aligned component $Φ_1$). Namely, if ${r_0=0}$ then the electromagnetic field is fully determined by ${Φ_0=Φ_2}$, and one gets the C-metric in the BR universe (including also the non-accelerating Schwarzschild-BR black hole). But if ${r_0\\neq 0}$ then the electromagnetic field is independently determined by both the external BR field and the field of a black hole itself, and this can be interpreted as the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole accelerating in the Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. Even though such an interpretation of the spacetime family is quite simple, it contains a lot of subtleties (e.g. the no-charge limit of the RN-BR spacetime, the non-trivial dependence on the signs of the mass and charge of a black hole, extreme black holes, and others) which we carefully investigate in this work. We also show the explicit relation to solutions previously found by Van den Bergh and Carminati, and we discuss the connection to the Alekseev-Garcia and Alexeev solutions."}

To this end, we focus on the class of $f(R,T)$ models defined by $f(R,T)=R+F(T)$, which provide a simple yet theoretically consistent realization of nonminimal matter-gravity interactions and can be reformulated as general relativity minimally coupled to a modified matter Lagrangian. Using nonstandard global monopole solutions as a toy model for realistic particles, we show that the spatial average of $F$ typically differs significantly from $F$ evaluated at the spatially averaged trace of $T$, implying that homogeneous cosmological models generally fail to capture the correct large-scale dynamics of the Universe. We further show that dust in these theories generally exhibits a non-vanishing proper pressure. Our results underscore the necessity of properly accounting for spatial averaging when modeling cosmology in theories with nonminimal matter-gravity couplings."}

Here we explore the variational formulation of classical Einstein-Hilbert gravity as initial value problem by constructing its Schwinger-Keldysh-Galley (SKG) action, including a careful treatment of boundary terms. The construction is based on a doubling of degrees of freedom and independent of a foliation. The action naturally decomposes into a bulk term furnishing Einstein's equations and a boundary term, which is related to conserved quantities, such as the Komar mass. We find that since only trivial connecting conditions must be specified on boundaries, the variational action principle for gravity as an initial value problem is rendered well-posed without the need to add additional boundary terms. The SKG approach to gravity offers a novel and complementary avenue to solve for the metric of spacetime directly from the action, bypassing the governing equations."}

These conditions restrict the curvature in such a way that the spacetime becomes conformally flat and belongs to the family of embedding class-I solutions. Even though the subsequent solutions namely, the Schwarzschild interior solution and the de Sitter solution are well known, the novelty of our presentation is that these solutions are shown to be a direct consequence of the imposed geometric constraints. The physical matter composition becomes highly constrained by the associated geometry under such conditions. The Schwarzschild interior solution describes the spacetime of an incompressible fluid sphere while the de Sitter solution corresponds to a vacuum energy dominated configuration. Interestingly, pressure anisotropy as well as `complexity factor' vanish identically once the Karmarkar's condition and the conformal flatness conditions are applied simultaneously. As these two geometric constraints alone are sufficient to determine the background spacetime uniquely, Karmarkar's condition might not be a suitable method for the development of realistic stellar models in a conformally flat spacetime unless one invokes other factors into consideration such as time-dependent metric potentials."}

In this study, we investigate how deviations from the standard nearly-scale-free primordial power spectrum impact observables for the fully compact, orientable Euclidean topologies ($E_1$--$E_6$). We examine how such deviations modify the detectability of the underlying topology, depending on whether they are an intrinsic consequence of non-trivial topology or independent of it. We compute CMB temperature correlation matrices across a range of topologies, fundamental domain sizes, and observer locations for both standard and modified primordial power spectra. The impact of these modifications on the detectability of topology is quantified using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, providing an estimate of the distinguishability of non-trivial and simply-connected topologies based solely on CMB temperature observations. In addition, we employ the CatBoost machine learning algorithm to classify harmonic-space realizations of CMB temperature maps and thereby assess the observational prospects for topology detection. Signatures of non-trivial topology are encoded in the off-diagonal structure of the CMB temperature correlation matrices and are most prominent on the largest angular scales. Deviations from the simple power-law primordial spectrum at these scales can substantially alter the detectability of topology, either enhancing its characteristic CMB imprints or suppressing them below observational sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that uncertainties in the primordial power spectrum must be carefully accounted for in robust searches for cosmic topology using the CMB."}

Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black hole candidates, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis and obtain constraints on the black hole parameters. The results show that the presence of the quantum correction significantly affects the location of the QPO radii and the separation between the QPO orbit and the ISCO.

The quasar (QSO) number densities are a powerful probe for understanding the effects of intervening material. Absorption lines in QSO spectra reveal the presence of interstellar and intergalactic gas, which can change observed fluxes through dust extinction and plasma lensing. By combining observations from radio (VLASS), infrared (WISE), and optical bands (DESI), we assembled a sample of QSOs: ~4000 sources with MgII absorbers, and ~12, 000 non-absorbers. In the radio band, the MgII sample shows a moderate excess at the bright end of the flux distribution, which is broadly consistent with plasma lensing predications. In the optical, the MgII sample turns over at higher g-band fluxes and exhibits a steeper decline at the faint end than the non-MgII sample. Control samples were constructed by matching in redshift, infrared (W1), and optical (g) luminosities. In these comparisons, the radio excess becomes less prominent, suggesting that the apparent magnification may not be robust evidence for plasma lensing. Nevertheless, a weak contribution cannot be ruled out, especially given residual excess observed at the bright end relative to the non-MgII sample. Dust extinction along the line-of-sight remains a plausible alternative.

Finally, we analyze the optical properties of the black hole, in particular the photon sphere and shadow radius, showing how these parameters influence these features."}

Based on the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations, combined with the Tulczyjew spin supplementary condition, we derive the orbital dynamic equations for spinning particles moving in the equatorial plane and impose a timelike constraint to exclude unphysical superluminal trajectories. By comparing with the classical Schwarzschild black hole, we systematically analyze the effects of the nonlocal gravitational parameters $ζ$ and $b$ on the effective potential governing the radial motion of particles and the innermost stable circular orbit. In addition, gravitational waveforms exhibit significant phase differences: an increase in $ζ$ induces a phase delay, whereas an increase in $b$ results in a phase advance. A one-year simulation of the orbital evolution of an extreme mass ratio inspiral demonstrates that when $b=2$ and $ζ\\approx10^{-6}$, the mismatch between the gravitational waveforms predicted for the nonlocal gravity black hole and those for the Schwarzschild black hole reaches the distinguishable threshold ($\\mathcal{M}=0.0125$), providing a basis for observational discrimination between general relativity and nonlocal gravity."}

In this model - the setting for a number of prominent case studies on black hole formation - charged massless particles may instantaneously change direction (bounce) after losing all their 4-momentum due to electrostatic repulsion. We initiate the study of timelike bounce hypersurfaces in spherical symmetry: scenarios in which an incoming beam of charged null dust changes direction along a timelike surface $\\mathcal{B}$, which is the (free) boundary of an interacting 2-dust region. We identify a novel decoupling of the equations of motion in this region. First, it is shown that every timelike curve segment $γ$ in the spherically symmetric quotient of Minkowski or Reissner-Nordström spacetimes arises as the bounce hypersurface $\\mathcal{B}$ of a charged null dust beam incident from past null infinity $\\mathcal{I}^-$. We construct a spacetime $(\\mathcal{M},g_{μν})$ describing the full trajectory of the beam, which includes gluing to Reissner-Nordström and Vaidya regions. Across $\\mathcal{B}$ the metric has regularity $g_{μν}\\in C^{2,1}$ and satisfies Einstein's equation classically, while $C^\\infty$ gluing may be achieved across all other interfaces. We also obtain examples of timelike bounce hypersurfaces terminating in a null point. Since these constructions are teleological, we secondly consider a given charged incoming beam from past null infinity. We formulate and solve a free boundary problem which represents the formation of a timelike bounce hypersurface. The result is conditional, applying only in the exterior region of a Reissner-Nordström spacetime, and subject to a technical regularity condition."}

It is shown that they may not be so exotic as usually expected. We show that NMOs appear as solutions of standard gravitational equations if we consider the system of a compact positive mass object, cosmological fluid and negative cosmological constant. We also construct models which generate such NMOs as solutions within the two-scalar theory and scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity inspired by string theory. The orbits of the photon and massive particles are investigated in the background, where there is a negative mass object which realises a kind of effective anti-gravity. It is explicitly found that the bound system consisting of a positive mass object and a negative mass object can be formed in spite that a positive mass object suffers the repulsive force from the NMO. The possibility that such exotic objects might be observed is discussed. A simple conjecture about their possible masses is made, too. As an even more exotic object, we consider a non-trivial object with vanishing mass and investigate its properties."}

To this end, we focus on the class of $f(R,T)$ models defined by $f(R,T)=R+F(T)$, which provide a simple yet theoretically consistent realization of nonminimal matter-gravity interactions and can be reformulated as general relativity minimally coupled to a modified matter Lagrangian. Using nonstandard global monopole solutions as a toy model for realistic particles, we show that the spatial average of $F$ typically differs significantly from $F$ evaluated at the spatially averaged trace of $T$, implying that homogeneous cosmological models generally fail to capture the correct large-scale dynamics of the Universe. We further show that dust in these theories generally exhibits a non-vanishing proper pressure. Our results underscore the necessity of properly accounting for spatial averaging when modeling cosmology in theories with nonminimal matter-gravity couplings."}

Because these features are extremely faint, alternative tracers such as globular clusters (GCs) provide a powerful tool to study cluster assembly. We use deep VLT/FORS $V$- and $I$-band imaging to investigate the GC population in the nearby Hydra I galaxy cluster ($\\sim 45.7$ Mpc). GC candidates were selected from the $VI$ colour-magnitude diagram and divided into blue and red subpopulations. We find a clear spatial dichotomy: red GCs are concentrated around the massive central galaxies NGC 3311 and NGC 3309, while blue GCs are more extended and offset from the centre, coinciding with a secondary peak of X-ray-emitting gas. In the central regions, GC spatial distributions further depend on stellar population properties: young metal-rich GCs are more extended and may be linked to ram-pressure stripping, whereas old metal-poor GCs are more centrally concentrated, possibly originating from disrupted dwarf galaxies. Comparing the GC number density profiles to the surface brightness profile of NGC 3311, we find that the red GCs closely follow the galaxy light, while the blue population significantly deviates from it and traces the global gravitational potential of the cluster. This is also reflected in the specific frequency of blue GCs, which is approximately $\\sim 5\\times$ higher in the ICL-dominated outskirts than in the inner regions dominated by red GCs. Finally, we present a novel method to constrain the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function of the cluster using GC specific frequencies and colour distributions, yielding a past faint-end slope of $α=-1.81^{+0.16}_{-0.16}$ compared to $α=-1.41^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$ today, consistent with high-redshift observations and cosmological simulations."}

Exploiting Hodge dualities, the theory is formulated in terms of two scalar functions that are associated with the conjugate momentum, and the three-form dual vector in an isotropic background. The resulting Lagrangian yields a stable scaling attractor where the three-form energy density tracks the dominant background fluid. A dynamical mechanism is also identified that naturally drives the system out of this regime toward a late-time accelerated phase distinguishable from a cosmological constant. This constitutes the first realization of scaling behavior within a three-form dark energy framework."}

Detectability with non-standard primordial power spectrum", "comment": "51 pages, 30 figures", "summary": "Non-trivial spatial topology of the Universe can imprint potentially observable signatures on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this study, we investigate how deviations from the standard nearly-scale-free primordial power spectrum impact observables for the fully compact, orientable Euclidean topologies ($E_1$--$E_6$). We examine how such deviations modify the detectability of the underlying topology, depending on whether they are an intrinsic consequence of non-trivial topology or independent of it. We compute CMB temperature correlation matrices across a range of topologies, fundamental domain sizes, and observer locations for both standard and modified primordial power spectra. The impact of these modifications on the detectability of topology is quantified using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, providing an estimate of the distinguishability of non-trivial and simply-connected topologies based solely on CMB temperature observations. In addition, we employ the CatBoost machine learning algorithm to classify harmonic-space realizations of CMB temperature maps and thereby assess the observational prospects for topology detection. Signatures of non-trivial topology are encoded in the off-diagonal structure of the CMB temperature correlation matrices and are most prominent on the largest angular scales. Deviations from the simple power-law primordial spectrum at these scales can substantially alter the detectability of topology, either enhancing its characteristic CMB imprints or suppressing them below observational sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that uncertainties in the primordial power spectrum must be carefully accounted for in robust searches for cosmic topology using the CMB."}
