Abstract: We present a large spectroscopic survey with \textit{JWST}'s Mid-Infrared
Instrument (MIRI) Low Resolution Spectrometer (LRS) targeting $37$
infrared-bright galaxies between $z=0.65-2.46$ with infrared luminosities $\log
L_{\rm IR}/L_\odot>11.5$ and $\log M_*/M_\odot=10-11.5$. Targets were taken
from a \textit{Spitzer} $24\,\mu$m-selected sample with archival spectroscopy
from the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) and include a mix of star-forming galaxies
and dust-obscured AGN. By combining IRS with the increased sensitivity of LRS,
we expand the range of spectral features observed between $5-30\,\mu$m for
every galaxy in our sample. In this paper, we outline the sample selection,
\textit{JWST} data reduction, 1D spectral extraction, and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon (PAH) feature measurements from $\lambda_{rest}=3.3-11.2\,\mu$m. In
the \textit{JWST} spectra, we detect PAH emission features at $3.3-5.3\,\mu$m,
as well as Paschen and Brackett lines. The $3.3\,\mu$m feature can be as bright
as $1\%$ of the $8-1000\,\mu$m infrared luminosity and exhibits a tight
correlation with the dust-obscured star-formation rate. We detect absorption
features from CO gas, CO$_2$ ice, H$_2$O ice, and aliphatic dust. From the
joint \textit{JWST} and \textit{Spitzer} analysis we find that the
$11.3/3.3\,\mu$m PAH ratios are on-average three times higher than that of
local luminous, infrared galaxies. This is interpreted as evidence that the PAH
grains are larger at $z\sim1-2$. The size distribution may be affected by
coagulation of grains due to high gas densities and low temperatures. These
conditions are supported by the observation of strong water ice absorption at
$3.05\,\mu$m, and can lower stellar radiative feedback as large PAHs transmit
less energy per photon into the interstellar medium.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Major mergers of galaxies are likely to trigger bursty star formation
activities. The accumulation of dense gas and the boost of star formation
efficiency (SFE) are considered to be the two main drivers of the starbursts.
However, it is still unclear how each process operates on the scale of
individual star-forming clouds. Here, we present a high-resolution (2 Msun) RHD
simulation of a gas-rich dwarf galaxy merger using the RIGEL model to
investigate how mergers affect the properties of the structure of dense
star-forming gas and the cloud-scale SFE. We track the evolution of sub-virial
dense clouds in the simulation by mapping them across successive snapshots
taken at intervals of 0.2 Myr. We found that the merger triggers a 130 times
higher SFR and shortens the galaxy-wide gas-depletion time by two orders of
magnitude compared to those of two isolated galaxies. However, the depletion
time of individual clouds and their lifetime distribution remained unchanged
over the simulation period. The cloud life cycles and cloud-scale SFE are
determined by the local stellar feedback rather than environmental factors
regardless of the merger process, and the integrated SFE ($\epsilon_{\rm int}$)
of clouds in complex environments is still well described by an $\epsilon_{\rm
int}-\Sigma_{\rm tot}$ relation found in idealized isolated-cloud experiments.
During the peak of the starburst, the median integrated SFE only changed by
0.17-0.33 dex lower compared to the value when the galaxies are not
interacting. The merger boosts the SFR primarily through the accumulation and
compression of dense gas fueling star formation. Strong tidal torques assemble
$>10^ 5$ Msun clouds that seed massive star clusters. The average separation
between star-forming clouds decreases during the merger, which in turn
decreases the cloud--cluster spatial decorrelation from >1 kpc to 0.1 kpc
depicted by tuning fork diagrams.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Wide-field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) is a powerful tool for studying large
samples of galaxies across cosmic times. With the arrival of JWST, and its
NIRCAM grism mode, slitless spectroscopy can reach a medium spectral resolution
of $(R\sim 1600)$, allowing it to spatially resolve the ionised-gas kinematics
out to $z\sim 9$. However, the kinematic information is convolved with
morphology along the dispersion axis, a degeneracy that must be modelled to
recover intrinsic properties. We present the Grism Emission-line Kinematics
tOol ($\texttt{geko}$), a Python package that forward-models NIRCam grism
observations and infers emission-line morphologies and kinematics within a
Bayesian framework. $\texttt{geko}$ combines S\'ersic surface-brightness models
with arctangent rotation curves, includes full point-spread function (PSF) and
line-spread function (LSF) convolution, and leverages gradient-based sampling
via $\texttt{jax}$/$\texttt{numpyro}$ for efficient inference. It recovers
parameters such as effective radius, velocity dispersion, rotational velocity,
rotational support, and dynamical mass, with typical run times of $\sim$20
minutes per galaxy on GPUs. We validate performance using extensive mock data
spanning position angle, S/N, and morphology, quantifying where degeneracies
limit recovery. Finally, we demonstrate applications to real FRESCO H$\alpha$
emitters at $z\approx 4-6$, recovering both rotation- and dispersion-dominated
systems. $\texttt{geko}$ opens the way to statistical studies of galaxy
dynamics in the early Universe and is publicly available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: JWST has identified a large population of faint, broad-line active galactic
nuclei (AGN) in the early universe that are powered by black holes (BHs) that
often appear overmassive relative to their host galaxies. In this study, we
examine the relationship between BH mass and galaxy stellar mass at $3<z<7$
using a sample of 70 broad-line AGN identified using NIRSpec/G395M spectroscopy
from the CEERS, JADES, and RUBIES surveys. Roughly half (43\%) of our sample
appear heavily reddened and are classified as little red dots (LRDs). We
estimate BH masses ($M_{\rm BH}$) using single-epoch virial techniques, while
host stellar masses ($M_{\star}$) are inferred using a combination of
two-dimensional surface brightness profile fitting and spectral energy
distribution modeling. We find that a majority of our sources (50/70) have
$M_{\rm BH}/M_{\star}$ ratios that are 1-2 dex higher than that observed in AGN
locally. Using a forward-modeling Bayesian framework that accounts for
uncertainties, intrinsic scatter, and selection effects, we infer a $M_{\rm
BH}-M_{\star}$ relationship that is $>3\sigma$ above the relationship measured
for local broad-line AGN. We derive an intrinsic scatter in this relationship
of $0.9$ dex, which does not vary over the redshift range of our sample. We
also find that the $M_{\rm BH}/M_{\star}$ ratio increases by $2.3$ dex from $z
= 3.5$ and $z = 6.5$ with a confidence level of $ > 3\sigma$. We attribute this
trend with the increasing fraction of LRDs in our sample at $z>4$ as their host
masses are $\sim1$ dex lower than the non-LRD AGN in our sample. These results
support a picture in which the BHs powering JWST's broad-line AGN are genuinely
overmassive and become increasingly so with redshift. We discuss the
implications of our findings on early BH growth relative to that of their host
galaxies and the constraints it places on BH seeding models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Compact symmetric objects (CSOs) are thought to be short-lived radio sources
with two lobes of emission that are separated by less than a kpc in projection.
However, studies of such systems at high redshift is challenging due to the
limited resolution of present-day telescopes, and can be biased to the most
luminous objects. Here we report imaging of a gravitationally lensed CSO at a
redshift of 2.059 using very long baseline interferometry at 1.7 GHz. The data
are imaged using Bayesian forward modelling deconvolution, which reveals a
spectacularly extended and thin gravitational arc, and several resolved
features within the lensed images. The surface brightness of the
lensing-corrected source shows two mini-lobes separated by 642 pc in
projection, with evidence of multiple hotspots that have brightness
temperatures of 10^8.6 to 10^9.2 K, and a total luminosity density of 10^26.3 W
/ Hz. By combining the well-resolved radio source morphology with previous
multi-wavelength studies, we conclude that this object is likely a CSO of type
2, and that the properties are consistent with the bow-shock model for compact
radio sources. Our analysis highlights the importance of combining high quality
data sets with sophisticated imaging and modelling algorithms for studying the
high redshift Universe.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) occupy the $ 10^2 - 10^5\,M_\odot $
range, but their existence remains poorly constrained. Only a few candidates
have been suggested in dwarf galaxies, globular clusters, and LIGO-Virgo-Kagra
detections. To investigate their formation and demographics, we adopt two
complementary approaches. We first analyze the \textsc{dragonii} direct
$N$-body simulations, which follow clusters with up to $ 10^6 $ stars, capture
IMBHs growth. We then employ the semi-analytic code \textsc{bpop}, calibrated
on \textsc{dragonii}, to explore a broad range of cluster and cosmological
conditions.
  Our models reproduce merger rates consistent with GWTC-3, with $\sim30 -
60\%$ of BBHs forming dynamically, mainly in globular and nuclear clusters.
About 2-3\% of mergers involve an IMBH, producing intermediate-mass ratio
inspirals. The IMBH mass distribution spans $2.5 \times 10^2 - 4 \times
10^4\,M_\odot $, with rare growth beyond $10^6\,M_\odot$. Formation efficiency
rises with initial binary fraction but declines in metal-rich environments.
IMBHs thus emerge as a distinct population bridging stellar and supermassive
black holes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Analyses of IFU data are typically performed on a per-spaxel basis, with each
spectrum modelled independently. For low signal-to-noise (S/N) features such as
weak emission lines, estimating properties is difficult and imprecise.
Arbitrary binning schemes boost S/N at the cost of resolution, and risk
introducing biases. We present a general forward-modelling approach that
assumes spectra close on the sky are more similar than distant ones, and so can
be modelled jointly. These "spectrospatial" models exploit spatial correlation
to provide robust inferences, while simultaneously providing continuous
predictions of line properties like strength and kinematics across the sky.
Instrumental and calibration systematics are straightforward to include and
infer. The model provides a natural trade-off between spatial resolution and
S/N in a data-driven way. We apply this to Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V)
Local Volume Mapper (LVM) data of the Rosette Nebula, producing continuous maps
of fluxes and kinematics for Balmer, nebular, and auroral lines, as well as
weak C II and N II recombination lines, demonstrating the approach across three
orders of magnitude in S/N, including in the very low-S/N regime. The method
recovers identical morphologies across different lines tracing similar
ionisation volumes, at varying resolutions set by the S/N. We additionally
provide a general framework for building and fitting such models in JAX,
suitable for many applications. The implementation is fast and memory
efficient, scales to large data volumes as in LVM, and can be deployed on
hardware accelerators.

Abstract: We investigate the evolution of the bar fraction and length using an extended
JWST NIRCam imaging dataset of galaxies in the $1 \leq z \leq 4$ redshift
range. We assess the wavelength dependence of the bar fraction in disc galaxies
and bar length evolution by selecting a nearly mass-complete CEERS disc sample
and performing independent visual classifications on the short (F200W) and long
(F356W+F444W) wavelength channels. A similar bar fraction is observed for both
samples, and combined we find a declining trend in the bar fraction:
$0.16^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$ at $1 \leq z < 2$; $0.08^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$ at $2 \leq z <
3$; $0.07^{+0.03}_{-0.01}$ at $3 \leq z \leq 4$. This corroborates our previous
work and other recent studies, suggesting that dynamically cold and
rotationally supported massive discs are present at Cosmic Noon. No evolution
in the F356W+F444W bar length is measured from $z = 4$ to $z = 1$, which has a
mean of 3.6\,kpc, but a slight increase of about 1\,kpc towards $z = 1$ is
measured in the F200W sample, which has a mean of 2.9\,kpc. The bar sample is
shorter in the short-wavelength channel due to the better physical spatial
resolution; however, we also suggest that dust obscuration plays a role. We
find that the correlation between bar length and galaxy mass for massive
galaxies observed at $z < 1$ is not seen at $z > 1$. By adding samples of
barred galaxies at $z<1$, we show that there is a modest increase in the bar
length ($\approx 2$\,kpc) towards $z=0$, but bars longer than $\approx8$\,kpc
are only found at $z<1$. We show that bars and discs grow in tandem, for the
bar length normalised by disc size does not evolve from $z = 4$ to $z = 0$. Not
only is a significant population of bars forming beyond $z = 1$, but our
results also show that some of these bars are as long and strong as the average
bar at $z\approx0$.

Abstract: Liller 1 is a stellar system orbiting within the inner 0.8kpc of the Galactic
centre, characterised by a wide spread in age and metallicity, indicating a
high mass. Liller 1 has been proposed to be a major contributor to the stellar
mass of the Galactic bulge, yet its origin is subject to debate. We employ
Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) data from the Apache Point Observatory
Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) to test scenarios proposed to explain
the nature of Liller 1. Using a random sampling technique, we contrast the
chemical compositions of Liller 1 stellar members with those of the bulge,
inner disc, outer disk and solar neighbourhood. The chemistry of Liller 1
deviates from that of the bulge population at the 2-3$\sigma$ level for
$\alpha$-elements Mg, Si, and Ca. We conclude that the progenitor of Liller 1
was not a major contributor of stellar mass to the bulge. Furthermore, we find
the abundance pattern of Liller 1 to deviate at the 2$\sigma$ level from that
of inner disk stars, ruling out the cluster rejuvenation scenario. Finally, we
find that Liller 1 is chemically distinct from solar and outer disc
populations, suggesting that the progenitor of Liller 1 is unlikely to be an
in-situ massive clump formed at high redshift, from disc gravitational
instabilities, that migrated inwards and coalesced with others into the bulge.
Finally, we suggest that Liller 1 is a minor contributor to the stellar mass of
the inner Galaxy, possibly of extragalactic origin.

Abstract: Observations of density variations in stellar streams are a promising probe
of low-mass dark matter substructure in the Milky Way. However, survey
systematics such as variations in seeing and sky brightness can also induce
artificial fluctuations in the observed densities of known stellar streams.
These variations arise because survey conditions affect both object detection
and star-galaxy misclassification rates. To mitigate these effects, we use
Balrog synthetic source injections in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 data to
calculate detection rate variations and classification rates as functions of
survey properties. We show that these rates are nearly separable with respect
to survey properties and can be estimated with sufficient statistics from the
synthetic catalogs. Applying these corrections reduces the standard deviation
of relative detection rates across the DES footprint by a factor of five, and
our corrections significantly change the inferred linear density of the Phoenix
stream when including faint objects. Additionally, for artificial streams with
DES like survey properties we are able to recover density power spectra with
reduced bias. We also find that uncorrected power-spectrum results for
LSST-like data can be around five times more biased, highlighting the need for
such corrections in future ground based surveys.

Abstract: White dwarf stars with high abundances of heavy elements in their atmospheres
and infrared excesses are believed to be accreting planetary material. GD 362
is one of the most heavily polluted white dwarfs and has an exceptionally
strong mid-infrared excess, reprocessing 2.4% of the star's light into the
mid-infrared. We present a high signal-to-noise, medium-resolution spectrum of
GD 362 obtained with JWST, covering 0.6 to 17 microns, along with photometry
out to 25.5 microns. The mid-infrared spectrum is dominated by an exceptionally
strong 9 to 11 micron silicate feature, which can be explained by a combination
of olivine and pyroxene silicate minerals. Grains such as carbon, hotter than
silicates, are required to explain the near-infrared emission. The silicates
and carbon reside in a disk from 140 to 1400 stellar radii, and the disk scale
height is greater than half the stellar radius. The elemental abundances of the
solid material, relative to Si, are within a factor of 2 of meteoritic (CI
chondrites) for C, O, Mg, Al, and Fe, with Al elevated and O slightly depleted.
A similar pattern is observed for the abundances of accreted material in the
stellar photosphere. Hydrogen is an exception, because no significant H-bearing
minerals or water were detected in the disk, despite a large H abundance in the
photosphere.

Abstract: We present a multi-modal foundation model for astrophysical galaxy data,
designed to map between simulation- and observation-based galactic features.
Our encoder-only transformer flexibly ingests scalar quantities (e.g.,
redshifts, galaxy masses) and vectors (e.g., star formation histories,
spectra), supporting multi-task training that includes within-modality
reconstruction and cross-modality prediction. With a dynamic masking strategy,
the model can query arbitrary galaxy properties from partial inputs --
including predicting spectra from redshift and mass, or estimating photometric
redshifts from broadband magnitudes -- while also recovering missing segments
within a modality. Trained on 185,000 simulated galaxies from a
gigaparsec-scale Cosmology simulation, the model yields a 50% improvement in
redshift estimation when combining LSST and SPHEREx photometry over LSST
photometry alone, and a 63% improvement in stellar mass inference when
combining late-time SFH with LSST photometry over early-time SFH with LSST
photometry. The model demonstrates strong generalization across multi-modal
tasks and lays the groundwork for future integration of higher-dimensional and
structured data such as images, merger trees, and 3D fields. This approach
provides a unified framework for connecting simulations and observations,
advancing the development of generalizable astrophysical foundation models.

Abstract: We present ALMA CO observations of 14 HI-detected galaxies from the CHILES
survey found in a cosmic over-density at z~0.12. This is the largest collection
of spatially resolved CO + HI observations beyond the local Universe (z>0.05)
to date. While the HI-detected parent sample spans a range of stellar masses,
star formation rates (SFR), and environments, we only directly detect CO in the
highest stellar mass galaxies, log(M_*/M_Sun)>10.0, with SFRs greater than ~2
M_Sun/yr. The detected CO has the kinematic signature of a rotating disk,
consistent with the HI. We stack the CO non-detections and find a mean H_2 mass
of log(M_H2/M_Sun) = 8.46 in galaxies with a mean stellar mass of
log(M_*/M_Sun) = 9.35. In addition to high stellar masses and SFRs, the systems
detected in CO are spatially larger, have redder overall colors, and exhibit
broader (stacked) line widths. The CO emission is spatially coincident with
both the highest stellar mass surface density and star forming region of the
galaxies, as revealed by the 1.4 GHz continuum emission. We interpret the
redder colors as the molecular gas being coincident with dusty regions of
obscured star formation. The 14 HI detections show a range of morphologies, but
the HI reservoir is always more extended than the CO. Finally, we compare with
samples in the literature and find mild evidence for evolution in the molecular
gas reservoir and H_2-to-HI gas ratio with redshift in HI flux-limited samples.
We show that the scatter in the HI, and HI-to-stellar mass ratio is too great
to conclusively measure evolution below z=0.2, and is even extremely difficult
below z=0.4. Detections from CHILES are likely to be the only individual
galaxies detected in HI between 0.1<z<0.23 for the foreseeable future due to
the severity of satellite radio frequency interference, and its preferential
impact on short baselines which dominate contemporary HI surveys.

Abstract: We show that host cold dark matter (CDM) haloes cluster in a manner that
depends upon the anisotropy/planarity of their subhaloes, indicating an
environmental dependence to subhalo anisotropy/planarity. The spatial
distribution of satellite galaxies about central galaxies and correspondingly,
the spatial distribution of subhaloes about host haloes have been subjects of
interest for two decades. Important questions include the degree to which
satellites are distributed anisotropically about their hosts or exhibit
planarity in their distributions and the degree to which this anisotropy
depends upon the environment of the host-satellite system. We study the spatial
distributions of subhaloes in a cosmological N-body simulation. We find that
CDM subhaloes are distributed in a manner that is strongly anisotropic/planar,
in agreement with prior work, though our presentation is complementary. The
more novel result is that this anisotropy has an environmental dependence.
Systems which exhibit less (more) anisotropy and less (more) planarity cluster
more strongly (weakly). Systems in which subhaloes reside further from their
host centres cluster more weakly. None of these clustering effects are caused
by a correlation between subhalo anisotropy/planarity and other properties on
which host halo clustering is known to depend, such as concentration, spin
parameter, host halo shape, or subhalo count. We discuss the impact of this
result on the anisotropy of satellites as predicted by CDM, its testability,
and its possible relation to anisotropy observed about the large galaxies of
the Local Group.

Abstract: Weak-line quasars (WLQs) are a subset of type 1 quasars with remarkably weak
high-ionization broad emission lines but normal optical/UV continua. Using
371,091 quasars from SDSS DR16, we define WLQs by analyzing outliers in three
relations: the L1350-CIV blueshift, the Baldwin effect, and the
logL2500-alpha_ox. We find two CIV EW thresholds: $8.9\pm0.2${\AA} and
$19.3\pm0.3${\AA}. WLQs (EW(CIV)<$8.9\pm0.2${\AA}) have enhanced CIV
blueshifts, deviate from the Baldwin effect, and include many X-ray weak
objects (nearly half). Normal quasars (EW(CIV)>$19.3\pm0.3${\AA}) show typical
properties, while bridge quasars (intermediate EW) are transitional. WLQs show
a positive correlation between line attenuation and ionization energy:
high-ionization lines (e.g., HeII, CIV) are suppressed by ~3-4{\sigma} compared
to low-ionization lines (e.g., MgII, OI). This supports the shielding gas
model, where a thick inner accretion disk obscures high-energy photons,
suppressing high-ionization lines, while low-ionization lines are less
affected. We suggest that WLQs and normal quasars correspond to slim and thin
disk regimes, respectively, with bridge quasars as a transitional phase. This
work provides a unified criterion for WLQs and highlights the role of
accretion-driven shielding gas in their spectral features.

Abstract: In this work, we present the program MOLLId (MOLecular Line Identification)
for automated molecular lines approximation with gaussian profile. Molecular
identification was performed using multi-level comparison of the lines' center
frequencies and rest frequencies from the spectroscopic database. The program
was tested using identification of the molecular lines in observational spectra
of young stellar objects RCW 120 YSO S1 and RCW 120 YSO S2, located near the
border of the RCW 120 PDR. In the spectra of the RCW 120 YSO S1 source, 100
lines of 41 molecules were identified over the level of 4-6 sigma. In the
spectra of the RCW 120 YSO S2 source, 407 lines of 79 molecules were identified
over the level 3-5 sigma. Using Intel Core i7-12700K CPU, identification time
is equal to 6 and 8 minutes per spectral range for the YSOs S1 and S2,
respectively. From the analysis of CH3OH, CH3CN, CH3CCH molecules identified in
RCW 120 YSO S2 we found a two-component structure and estimated the physical
parameters in the LTE approximation for each of the components.

Abstract: Galaxies falling into galaxy clusters can leave imprints on both the corona
of galaxies and the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters. Throughout
this infall process, the galaxy's atmosphere is subjected to ram pressure from
a headwind, leading to the stripping morphology observed in its tail. The
morphological evolution is affected by the properties of the surrounding ICM
such as magnetic fields and viscosity. In this Letter, we perform 3D
Braginskii-magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the FLASH code with varied ICM
viscosity models. Specifically, we explore four models: an inviscid case,
unsuppressed isotropic viscosity, unsuppressed anisotropic viscosity, and
anisotropic viscosity suppressed by plasma instabilities. Our findings indicate
that the isotropic viscosity case effectively suppresses hydrodynamic
instabilities and shows strong viscous heating and the least mixing with the
ICM, enabling the formation of long, coherent tails. The inviscid model has the
shortest tail due to vigorous mixing, and the models with anisotropic viscosity
are in between. The model with suppressed anisotropic viscosity due to plasma
instabilities exhibits enhanced turbulence in the galactic tail and a
concurrent limitation in viscous heating compared to the model neglecting
plasma instabilities. These findings highlight the significant impact of ICM
plasma physics on the processes of ram pressure stripping of galaxies.

Abstract: We present JWST observations of the environments surrounding two
high-redshift quasars -- J0252$-$0503 at $z = 7.0$ and J1007$+$2115 at $z =
7.5$ -- which enable the first constraints on quasar-galaxy clustering at $z
\sim 7.3$. Galaxies in the vicinity of the quasars are selected through
ground-based and JWST/NIRCam imaging and then spectroscopically confirmed with
JWST/NIRSpec using the multi-shutter assembly (MSA). Over both fields, we
identify 51 $z>5$ galaxies, of which eight are found within a $\Delta
v_{\textrm{LOS}}=\pm1500 \rm{km} \rm{s}^{-1}$ line-of-sight velocity window
from the quasars and another eight in the background. The galaxy J0252\_8713,
located just $7\,\rm{pkpc}$ and $\Delta v_{\textrm{LOS}} \approx
360\,\rm{km}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$ from quasar J0252$-$0503, emerges as a compelling
candidate for one of the most distant quasar-galaxy mergers. Combining the
galaxy discoveries over the two fields, we measure the quasar-galaxy
cross-correlation and obtain a correlation length of
$r_0^{\rm{QG}}\approx7.6_{-1.6}^{+1.7}\,h^{-1}\,\rm{cMpc}$, based on a
power-law model with a fixed slope of $\gamma_{\rm{QG}} = 2.0$. Under the
assumption that quasars and galaxies trace the same underlying dark matter
density fluctuations, we infer a minimum dark matter halo mass for $z\simeq7.3$
quasars of $\log_{10}(M_{\textrm{halo, min}}/\textrm{M}_{\odot})= 11.6\pm0.6$
in a halo model framework. Compared to measurements from EIGER at $\langle z
\rangle = 6.25$ and ASPIRE at $\langle z \rangle = 6.7$ (where
$\log_{10}(M_{\textrm{halo, min}}/\textrm{M}_{\odot}) \gtrsim 12.3$), our
clustering results provide tentative evidence for a non-monotonic redshift
evolution of quasar clustering properties. We further estimate a quasar duty
cycle of $f_{\rm{duty}}\approx0.1\%$, consistent with constraints from quasar
proximity zones and IGM damping wings. (abridged)

Abstract: Observations of the redshifted 21-cm line during the Epoch of Reionization
will open a new window to probe the intergalactic medium during the formation
of the first stars, galaxies, and black holes. A particularly promising route
to an initial detection is to cross-correlate tomographic 21-cm maps with
spectroscopically confirmed Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs). High-redshift LAEs
preferentially reside in ionized bubbles that are strongly anticorrelated with
the surrounding neutral regions traced by 21-cm observations. In this work, we
study the prospect of detecting such a cross-correlation signal by stacking
21-cm image cubes around LAEs using a current-generation 21-cm instrument --
the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA). Our forecast adopts a
realistic mapping pipeline to generate foreground-free 21-cm image cubes. The
statistical properties of these images, arising from the complex instrumental
response, are carefully accounted for. We further introduce a physically
motivated signal template calibrated on the THESAN radiation-hydrodynamic
simulations, which connects the cross-correlation amplitude to the global
neutral fraction. Our results show that a sample of ~50 spectroscopically
confirmed LAEs is sufficient to begin constraining the reionization history.
These results represent an important preparatory step toward joint analyses of
21-cm experiments with upcoming wide-area, high-redshift galaxy surveys from
Euclid and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Control variates have seen recent interest as a powerful technique to reduce
the variance of summary statistics measured from costly cosmological $N$-body
simulations. Of particular interest are the class of control variates which are
analytically calculable, such as the recently introduced 'Zeldovich control
variates' for the power spectrum of matter and biased tracers. In this work we
present the construction of perturbative control variates in Eulerian and
Lagrangian perturbation theory, and adopt the matter bispectrum as a case
study. Eulerian control variates are analytically tractable for all $n$-point
functions, but we show that their correlation with the $N$-body $n$-point
function decays at a rate proportional to the sum-of-squared wavenumbers,
hampering their utility. We show that the Zeldovich approximation, while
possessing an analytically calculable bispectrum, is less correlated at low-$k$
than its Eulerian counterpart. We introduce an alternative -- the 'shifted
control variate' -- which can be constructed to have the correct tree-level
$n$-point function, is Zeldovich-resummed, and in principle has an analytically
tractable bispectrum. We find that applying this shifted control variate to the
$z=0.5$ matter bispectrum is equivalent to averaging over $10^4$ simulations
for the lowest-$k$ triangles considered. With a single $V=1({\rm Gpc}/h)^3$
$N$-body simulation, for a binning scheme with $N\approx 1400$ triangles from
$k_{\rm min} = 0.04 h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ to $k_{\rm \max} = 0.47 h {\rm
Mpc}^{-1}$, we obtain sub-2% precision for every triangle configuration
measured. This work enables the development of accurate bispectrum emulators --
a probe of cosmology well-suited to simulation-based modeling -- and lays the
theoretical groundwork to extend control variates for the entire $n$-point
hierarchy.

Abstract: Structure on sub-galactic scales provides important tests of galaxy formation
models and the nature of dark matter. However, such objects are typically too
faint to provide robust mass constraints. Here, we report the discovery of an
extremely low-mass object detected via its gravitational perturbation to a thin
lensed arc observed with milli-arcsecond-resolution very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI). The object was identified using a non-parametric
gravitational imaging technique and confirmed using independent parametric
modelling. It contains a mass of $m_{\rm 80}=(1.13 \pm 0.04)\times
10^6{M_\odot}$ within a projected radius of 80 parsecs at an assumed redshift
of 0.881. This detection is extremely robust and precise, with a statistical
significance of 26$\sigma$, a 3.3 per cent fractional uncertainty on $m_{\rm
80}$, and an astrometric uncertainty of 194 $\mu$as. This is the lowest-mass
object known to us, by two orders of magnitude, to be detected at a
cosmological distance by its gravitational effect. This work demonstrates the
observational feasibility of using gravitational imaging to probe the
million-solar-mass regime far beyond our local Universe.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Context: Rotational CO transitions, while acting as a foreground for [C II]
line-intensity mapping (LIM) experiments, trace the physical conditions of cold
gas in galaxies at lower redshifts. Studying these transitions is also crucial
for improving component-separation methods as LIM sensitivity increases. Aims:
Galaxy-evolution models have so far predicted only the total CO LIM signal. We
explore the potential of cross-correlating millimeter-wave LIM data with
spectroscopic galaxy surveys to constrain individual CO-line contributions,
measure the CO-background spectral line energy distribution (SLED), and derive
the cosmic molecular gas density, $\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}(z)$, up to $z = 3$.
Methods: We built 12 light cones of $9~\mathrm{deg}^2$ from the Simulated
Infrared Extragalactic Sky (SIDES) simulation. By analyzing cross-power spectra
between different CO transitions and the galaxy density field, we recovered the
CO background SLED. Combining it with bias-weighted line intensities yielded
$\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}(z)$. We also assessed the detectability of the CO(4--3)
cross-power spectrum with a CONCERTO-like experiment. Results: For a realistic
spectroscopic depth, the CO background SLED is accurately recovered up to
$J_{\mathrm{up}} = 6$ with $\leq 20%$ uncertainties. Reconstructing
$\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}$ from millimeter LIM data requires an excitation correction
relative to CO(1--0). Interloper-induced variance does not prevent precise
$\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}$ estimation. In the two-star-formation-mode SIDES model,
starbursts dominate the SLED at $J_{\mathrm{up}} \geq 6$ but do not bias
$\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}$ estimates from $2 \leq J_{\mathrm{up}} \leq 6$. However,
CONCERTO lacks the sensitivity to detect the CO$\times$galaxy cross-power on
relevant scales, even under ideal conditions.

Abstract: Supernova H0pe is a multiply-imaged Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) and the second
lensed SN to yield a measurement of the Hubble constant by the time-delay
cosmography method, finding $H_0 = 75.4^{+8.1}_{-5.5} \text{km s}^{-1}
\text{Mpc}^{-1}$. We investigate the seven lens modeling approaches used to
derive $H_0$, assessing their agreement with $\Lambda \text{CDM}$ constraints
from SN Ia surveys through a purely observational comparison. While
photometrically derived magnifications yield distance moduli in line with
$\Lambda \text{CDM}$ expectations, our comparison reveals that lens model
predictions, even the most precise ones, consistently overestimate the
magnification, with a offset of $ \Delta \mu > 1$ mag. This known bias, already
appreciated by modeling teams, is independently confirmed through our analysis
and highlights the value of lensed SNe as a tool to test model accuracy. If
unaccounted for, such magnification biases can propagate into uncertainties in
derived cosmological parameters, including $H_0$, and affect the interpretation
of future precision measurements. These findings highlight a critical challenge
for precision cosmology using strongly lensed transients. With next-generation
surveys such as LSST, Roman, and Euclid poised to discover many more
gravitationally lensed supernovae, the development and validation of robust,
accurate lens models will be essential for using these rare events to probe
cosmology.

Abstract: The peculiar velocities of supernovae and their host galaxies are correlated
with the large-scale structure of the Universe, and can be used to constrain
the growth rate of structure and test the cosmological model. In this work, we
measure the correlation statistics of the large-scale structure traced by the
Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Bright Galaxy Survey Data Release 1
sample, and magnitude fluctuations of type Ia supernova from the Pantheon+
compilation across redshifts z < 0.1. We find a detection of the
cross-correlation signal between galaxies and type Ia supernova magnitudes.
Fitting the normalised growth rate of structure f sigma_8 to the auto- and
cross-correlation function measurements we find f sigma_8 = 0.384 +0.094
-0.157, which is consistent with the Planck LambdaCDM model prediction, and
indicates that the supernova magnitude fluctuations are induced by peculiar
velocities. Using a large ensemble of N-body simulations, we validate our
methodology, calibrate the covariance of the measurements, and demonstrate that
our results are insensitive to supernova selection effects. We highlight the
potential of this methodology for measuring the growth rate of structure, and
forecast that the next generation of type Ia supernova surveys will improve f
sigma_8 constraints by a further order of magnitude.

by the amplitude of a scale-invariant anisotropic birefringence spectrum,
$A_{\rm CB}$. Using the new SPT-3G data we report a $95\%$ upper limit on
$A_{\rm CB}$ of $ 1.2\times 10^{-4}$, which tightens to $0.53\times 10^{-4}$
when imposing a prior on the amplitude of gravitational lensing based on CMB

Abstract: Astrophysical processes can contribute to magnetic fields within cosmic voids
either through magnetized outflows from the astrophysical large-scale structure
or through superposition of dipolar contributions from individual galaxies.
Such astrophysical magnetic fields represent a foreground to possible
space-filling primordial magnetic fields seeded in the early Universe. In this
paper, we provide a qualitative description of the screening of magnetic fields
by intergalactic plasmas. We find that contributions from superposition of
static dipoles are highly suppressed and cannot explain indications for lower
bounds based on observations of $\gamma$-ray cascades from high energy sources
such as blazars.

Abstract: Combinations of galaxy surveys and cosmic microwave background secondaries,
such as the thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich (tSZ) effect, are increasingly being used
to jointly constrain cosmology and astrophysical properties of the gas within
and beyond halos. Standard cross-correlations measure a directionless
correlation between the microwave maps and galaxy catalogs. However, more
information about the cosmic web structure can be captured by summary
statistics which include environmental constraints and measure oriented
correlations along axes of structure, such as filaments or superclusters. This
work studies the sensitivity of multipole moments of constrained oriented
stacks, a directional and environmentally-dependent statistic, to variations in
cosmological and astrophysical parameters. We run nine different 2.4
Gpc-per-side simulations with the Websky algorithm, varying the dark matter
energy density within flat $\Lambda$CDM, and create mock tSZ maps with each. We
also apply six different gas prescriptions, imitating AGN feedback variations,
to the fiducial cosmology. We analyze oriented stacks of the tSZ signal in
supercluster regions in each simulation, focusing on signal out to $\sim20$
transverse Mpc from massive ($M>5\times10^{13}~M_\odot$) halos. The cosmology
variations affect anisotropic and isotropic measurements similarly, while the
halo-pasted gas variations mostly affect the isotropic signal. Our results
suggest it is worthwhile to incorporate directional information into SZ-galaxy
cross-correlations to increase cosmological sensitivity and help break
degeneracies with gas physics.

Abstract: Observational data play a pivotal role in identifying cosmological models
that are both theoretically consistent and empirically viable. In this work, we
investigate whether the standard $\Lambda$CDM model exhibits significant
departure with current late time datasets, including Cosmic Chronometers,
Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from DESI DR2, and various Type Ia supernova
compilations (Pantheon$^+$, DES-SN5Y, Union3). We analyze several dynamical
dark energy models, including $\omega$CDM, o$\omega$CDM, $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM,
Logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE. While CC + DESI DR2 data show mild
deviations from $\Lambda$CDM ($\lesssim 2\sigma$), adding supernova samples
(DES-SN5Y or Union3) increases deviations, with BA, JBP, and Logarithmic models
reaching $3-3.5\sigma$, and CC + DESI DR2 + DES-SN5Y producing the largest
deviations. We find consistent evidence for $\omega_0 > -1$ and $\omega_a < 0$
in all dark energy models, indicating that the cosmological constant faces a
potential crisis and that dynamical dark energy models could provide a possible
solution, characterized by a Quintom-B type scenario. The $\Lambda$CDM model
has long served as the cornerstone of modern cosmology, successfully shaping
our understanding of the Universe from its earliest epochs to the present day.
However, in light of DESI DR2 and other recent measurements, emerging cracks in
this paradigm suggest that a complete understanding of the cosmos may require
moving beyond the cosmological constant and exploring new physics governing the
dark sector.

Abstract: We demonstrate that measurements of the gravitational tidal field made with
spectroscopic redshifts can be improved with information from imaging surveys.
The average orientation of small groups of galaxies, or "multiplets" is
correlated with large-scale structure and is used to measure the direction of
tidal forces. Previously, multiplet intrinsic alignment has been measured in
DESI using galaxies that have spectroscopic redshifts. The DESI Legacy Imaging
catalog can be used to supplement multiplet catalogs. Our findings show that
galaxy positions from the imaging catalog produce a measurement similar to the
measurements made with only spectroscopic data. This demonstrates that imaging
can improve our signal-to-noise ratio for multiplet alignment in DESI.

Abstract: The Conditional Luminosity Function (CLF) is an effective and flexible way of
characterizing the galaxy-halo connection. However, it is subject to a
particular choice for its parametrization, which acts as a prior assumption.
Most studies have been restricted to what has become a standard CLF
parametrization with little to no variation. The goal of this paper is to
investigate whether this model is sufficient to fully characterize the
small-scale data extracted from spectroscopic surveys and to gauge how adding
or removing degrees of freedom impact the inference regarding the galaxy-halo
connection. After extensive validation with realistic mock data, we use
Basilisk, a highly constraining Bayesian hierarchical tool to model the
kinematics and abundance of satellite galaxies, to test the standard CLF model
against a slew of more flexible variants. In particular, we test whether the
SDSS data favour any of these variants in terms of a goodness-of-fit
improvement, and identify the models that are sufficiently flexible, beyond
which additional model freedom is not demanded by the data. We show that some
of these additional degrees of freedom, which have hitherto not been
considered, result in a drastic improvement of the fit and cause significant
changes in the inferred galaxy-halo connection. This highlights that an
empirical model comes with an implicit prior about the parametrization form,
which needs to be addressed to ensure that it is sufficiently flexible to
capture the complexity of the data and to safeguard against a biased inference.

Abstract: In the present work, we study a subclass of Horndeski gravity characterized
by a non-minimal derivative coupling between a scalar field and the Einstein
tensor, as a possible alternative to alleviate the observational tension
associated with estimates of the Hubble constant $H_{0}$. Two scenarios within
a flat FRW spacetime were considered. In the first case, the scalar field
mimics cold dark matter, whereas in the second case, it acts as dark energy. We
derive the dynamical equations and perform a statistical analysis using
observational data of $H(z)$, obtaining constraints for the cosmological
parameters. The results indicate that the model can effectively fit the cosmic
expansion rate at late epochs, providing values of $H_{0}$ that are more
compatible with local measurements. These results suggest that the non-minimal
coupling sector in the Horndeski context constitutes a viable and promising
approach to alleviate the $H_{0}$ tension and investigate scenarios beyond the
standard cosmological model.

Abstract: In the context of maximum-likelihood parametric component separation for
next-generation full-sky CMB polarization experiments, we study the impact of
fitting different spectral parameters of Galactic foregrounds in distinct
subsets of pixels on the sky, with the goal of optimizing the search for
primordial B modes. Using both simulations and analytical arguments, we
highlight how the post-component separation uncertainty and systematic
foreground residuals in the cleaned CMB power spectrum depend on spatial
variations in the spectral parameters. We show that allowing spectral
parameters to vary across subsets of the sky pixels is essential to achieve
competitive S/N on the reconstructed CMB after component separation while
keeping residual foreground bias under control. Although several strategies
exist to define pixel subsets for the spectral parameters, each with its
advantages and limitations, we show using current foreground simulations in the
context of next-generation space-borne missions that there are satisfactory
configurations in which both statistical and systematic residuals become
negligible. The exact magnitude of these residuals, however, depends on the
mission's specific characteristics, especially its frequency coverage and
sensitivity. We also show that the post-component separation statistical
uncertainty is only weakly dependent on the properties of the foregrounds and
propose a semi-analytical framework to estimate it. On the contrary, the
systematic foreground residuals highly depend on both the properties of the
foregrounds and the chosen spatial resolution of the spectral parameters.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Observations have repeatedly confirmed the presence of large-scale peculiar
motions in the universe, commonly referred to as ``bulk flows''. These are vast
regions of the observable universe, typically spanning scales of several
hundred Mpc, that move coherently with speeds of the order of several hundred
km/sec. While there is a general consensus on the direction of these motions,
discrepancies persist in their reported sizes and velocities, with some of them
exceeding the predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The observed
large-scale peculiar-velocity fields are believed to have originated as weak
peculiar-velocity perturbations soon after equipartition, which have
subsequently grown by structure formation and by the increasing inhomogeneity
of the post-recombination universe. However, the evolution and the implications
of these bulk velocity fields remain poorly understood and they are still a
matter of debate. For instance, it remains a challenge for the theoreticians to
explain the high velocities measured by several bulk-flow surveys, like those
recently reported using the CosmicFlows-4 data. Such extensive and fast
velocity fields could have played a non-negligible role during structure
formation and they might have also ``contaminated'' our observations. After
all, in the history of astronomy, there are examples where relative-motion
effects have led us to a serious misinterpretation of reality (shortened
abstract due to length limits).

Abstract: Two distinct non-singular interior models that describe anisotropic spherical
configurations are presented in this work. We develop the Einstein field
equations and the associated mass function in accordance with a static
spherical spacetime. We then discuss certain requirements that must be
satisfied for compact models to be physically validated. Two distinct
limitations are taken into account to solve the field equations, including
different forms of the radial geometric component and anisotropy, which
ultimately leads to a couple of relativistic models. In both cases, solving the
differential equations result in the appearance of integration constants. By
equating the Schwarzschild exterior metric and spherical interior line element
on the interface, these constants are explicitly obtained. The disappearance of
the radial pressure on the hypersurface is also used in this context. We
further use estimated radii and masses of six different stars to graphically
visualize the physical properties of new solutions. Both of our models are
deduced to be well-aligned with all physical requirements, indicating the
superiority of the presence of anisotropy in compact stellar interiors over the
perfect isotropic fluid content.

Abstract: In our recent work [Van de Moortel, The coexistence of null and spacelike
singularities inside spherically symmetric black holes], we analyzed the
transition between null and spacelike singularities in spherically symmetric
dynamical black holes and demonstrated that the spacelike portion is described
by a Kasner metric with positive varying exponents that degenerate to $(1,0,0)$
near the null-spacelike transition. In the present paper, we provide examples
of global spacetimes satisfying the assumptions of this previous result and
apply its analysis to obtain a large class of asymptotically flat (spherically
symmetric) black hole spacetimes that exhibit coexisting null and spacelike
singularities. Our main results include:
  _The construction of one-ended asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes
solving the Einstein-Maxwell-charged-scalar-field equations. The proof relies
on a new spacelike-characteristic gluing method between any uncharged
spherically symmetric solution and the event horizon of a charged dynamical
black hole.
  _The construction of a large class of two-ended asymptotically flat black
hole spacetimes solving the Einstein-Maxwell-(uncharged)-scalar-field
equations.
  In both cases, we show that the terminal boundary in the black hole interior
only has two distinct components: a weakly singular (null) Cauchy horizon
$\mathcal{CH}_{i^+}$ where curvature blows up and a strong singularity
$\mathcal{S}=\{r=0\}$.
  Our construction provides the first examples of black holes with coexisting
null and spacelike singularities. These examples hold particular significance
in the one-ended case as a model of gravitational collapse, where this
phenomenon is conjecturally generic for the Einstein-scalar-field model, even
beyond spherical symmetry.

Abstract: We perform time-domain evolutions of the ergoregion instability on a
horizonless spinning ultracompact spacetime in scalar theories with
potential-type and derivative self-interactions mimicking the nonlinear
structure of the Einstein equations. We find that the instability saturates by
triggering a weakly turbulent direct cascade, which transfers energy from the
most unstable and large-scale modes to small scales. The cascade's nonlinear
timescales of each mode are orders of magnitude shorter than the corresponding
linear e-folding times. Through this mechanism, the counter-rotating stable
light ring is filled with a spectrum of higher-order azimuthal modes forming a
ring-like shape. Thereby we demonstrate that turbulent processes are likely
also important during the fully gravitational saturation of the instability,
leaving imprints in the gravitational wave emission.

Abstract: Ultracompact spinning horizonless spacetimes with ergoregions are subject to
the ergoregion instability. We systematically investigate the instability of a
massless scalar field in a variety of rapidly spinning Proca stars and boson
stars using WKB-, frequency-, and time-domain methods. We find universal
features in the mode structure: the onset of the instability is signaled by a
zero-mode, the mode frequencies and growth rates are related by a simple
scaling relation in the small-frequency limit (as found for Kerr-like objects),
the mode frequencies approach the orbital frequency of counter-rotating stably
trapped null geodesics in the eikonal limit, and for each unstable azimuthal
mode only a finite number of overtones and polar modes are exponentially
growing. The e-folding times are as short as $\tau\sim 10^4 M$ (in terms of the
spacetime's ADM mass $M$). Interestingly, we find a near universal relationship
between the frequencies and growth rates across all bosonic stars and also
compared with Kerr-like objects. Furthermore, we show that weakly nonlinear
backreaction of the instability induces a shift in growth rates as well as
emission of gravitational waves; we find evidence that these effects lead to an
amplification of the unstable process. This suggests that strongly nonlinear
interactions are important during the gravitational saturation of the
instability.

Abstract: We investigate a rotating black hole embedded in a five-dimensional flat bulk
by extending the Kerr metric through the Gurses-Gursey line element. Employing
Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, we reinterpret the black hole as a charged-like
object in five dimensions and analyze its horizon structure and shadow
morphology. Our results reveal that the shadow is shaped by an axially
symmetric gravitational field modulated by an extrinsic curvature term arising
from the higher-dimensional embedding. Simulations demonstrate that the
visibility amplitude and shadow profile of the Gurses-Gursey black hole align
with Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87 in the Kerr limit, while also
allowing measurable deviations that could be probed by future high-resolution
experiments.

as some that involve only the separated radial and angular modes. We expect
these analytic results to prove useful in numerical studies of black hole

angular momentum to uphold spinning particles within their characteristic
orbits at equivalent radial distances. Our result contributes valuable insights

Abstract: Th spontaneous scalarization of the Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg (EEH) black
hole is performed in the EEH-scalar theory by introducing an exponential scalar
coupling (with $\alpha$ coupling constant) to the Maxwell term.Here, the EEH
black hole as a blad black hole is described by mass $M$ and magnetic charge
$q$ with an action parameter $\mu$. A choice of $\mu=0.3$ gurantees a single
horizon with unrestricted magnetic charge $q$. The onset scalarization of this
black hole appears for a positive coupling $\alpha$ with an unlimited magnetic
charge $q$. However, there exists a difference between $q\le1$ and $q>1$ onset
scalarizations. We notify the presence of infinite branches labeled by the
number of $n=0,1,2,\cdots$ of scalarized charged black holes by taking into
account the scalar seeds around the EEH black hole. We find that the $n=0$
fundamental branch of all scalarized black holes is stable against the radial
perturbations, while the $n=1$ excited branch is unstable.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In studies of binary black hole (BBH) mergers in eccentric orbits, the mean
anomaly, traditionally regarded as less significant than eccentricity, has been
thought to encode only the orbital phase, leading to the assumption that it
exerts minimal influence on the dynamics of eccentric mergers. In a previous
investigation, we identified consistent oscillations in dynamical quantities
peak luminosity $L_{\text{peak}}$, remnant mass $M_{\text{rem}}$, spin
$\alpha_{\text{rem}}$, and recoil velocity $V_{\text{rem}}$ in relation to the
initial eccentricity $e_0$. These oscillations are associated with integer
orbital cycles within a phenomenological framework. In this paper, we aim to
explore the underlying physical nature of these oscillations through
gravitational waveforms. Our examination of remnant mass and spin reveals that
while the initial ADM mass $M_{\mathrm{ADM}}$ and orbital angular momentum
$L_0$ exhibit gradual variations with $e_0$, the radiated energy
$E_{\text{rad}}$ and angular momentum $L_{\text{rad}}$ display oscillatory
patterns akin to those observed in $M_{\text{rem}}$ and $\alpha_{\text{rem}}$.
By decomposing the waveforms into three distinct phases inspiral, late inspiral
to merger, and ringdown, we demonstrate that these oscillations persist across
all phases, suggesting a common origin. Through a comparative analysis of
$E_{\text{rad}}$ and $L_{\text{rad}}$ derived from numerical relativity (NR),
post-Newtonian (PN) waveforms, and orbital-averaged PN fluxes during the
inspiral phase, we identify the initial mean anomaly $l_0$ as the source of the
observed oscillations. ...

an analytical expression for the effective potential of the axial perturbation
modes, valid to all orders in the noncommutativity parameter. This is achieved
by evaluating the $\star$-products using translations in the radial direction,
i.e., Bopp shift. We comment on various regimes, such as Planck-scale black
holes, where the noncommutativity length scale is of the same order of

Abstract: We perform a full Hamiltonian constraint analysis of pure
Ricci-scalar-squared ($R^2$) gravity to clarify recent controversies regarding
its particle spectrum. While it is well established that the full theory
consistently propagates three degrees of freedom, we confirm that its
linearised spectrum around Minkowski spacetime is empty. moreover, we show that
this is not a feature unique to Minkowski spacetime, but a generic property of
all traceless-Ricci spacetimes that have a vanishing Ricci scalar, such as the
Schwarzschild and Kerr black hole spacetimes. The mechanism for this phenomenon
is a change in the nature of the constraints upon linearisation: ten
second-class constraints of the full theory become first-class, while the three
momentum constraints degenerate into a single constraint. Furthermore, we show
that higher order perturbation theory around these singular backgrounds reveals
no degrees of freedom at any order. This is in conflict with the general
analysis and points to the fact that such backgrounds are surfaces of strong
coupling in field space, where the dynamics of perturbations becomes
nonperturbative. We further show via a cosmological phase-space analysis that
the evolving universe is able to penetrate through the singular $R=0$ surface.

Abstract: Limits on the dark matter fraction of small mass primordial black holes from
Hawking radiation are predominantly derived from the assumption of a
Schwarzschild black hole evaporating. However, astrophysical black holes are
usually much more realistically modelled by the rotating Kerr black hole
solution. Meanwhile, electromagnetically charged black holes are
astrophysically of little importance due to their fast neutralisation in the
present universe. Dark matter is not just a possible solution to issues of
astrophysics and cosmology, but also to issues of the standard model of
particle physics. Extensions of this model thus can lead to charges present in
the early universe which remain preserved in the charge of primordial black
holes - even when the corresponding particles have disappeared from the
particle content of the present epoch of the universe. Here, we report on a
thorough proof-of-concept that such charges can greatly change evaporation
limits for primordial black hole dark matter. Special emphasis is placed on
(near-)extremal black holes, for which this effect is especially pronounced.

Abstract: The Lyra geometry provides an interesting approach to develop purely
geometrical scalar-tensor theories due to the natural presence of the Lyra
scale function. This paper explores further the scale function source term to
construct a theory on Lyra manifolds which contains proper generalizations of
both Brans-Dicke gravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory. It
is shown that the symmetry group of gravitational theories on the Lyra geometry
comprises not only coordinate transformations but also local transformations of
length units, so that the Lyra function is the conformal factor which locally
fixes the unit of length. By performing a Lyra transformation to a frame in
which the unit of length is globally fixed, it is shown that General Relativity
is obtained from the Lyra Scalar-Tensor Theory (LyST). Through the same
procedure, even in the presence of matter fields, it is found that Brans-Dicke
gravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory are obtained from
their Lyra counterparts. It is argued that this approach is consistent with the
Mach-Dicke principle, since the strength of gravity in Brans-Dicke-Lyra is
controlled by the scale function. It might be possible that any known
scalar-tensor theory can be naturally geometrized by considering a particular
Lyra frame, for which the scalar field is the function which locally controls
the unit of length. The Jordan-Einstein frame conundrum is also assessed from
the perspective of Lyra transformations, it is shown that the Lyra geometry
makes explicit that the two frames are only different representations of the
same theory, so that in the Einstein frame the unit of length varies locally.
The Lyra formalism is then shown to be better suited for exploring
scalar-tensor gravity, since in its well-defined structure the conservation of
the energy-momentum tensor and geodesic motion are assured in the Einstein
frame.

Abstract: The final-parsec problem has long posed a central challenge in understanding
the merger of supermassive black hole binaries. In this paper, we investigate a
scenario in which a dark scalar or vector field is sourced by eccentric
binaries, leading to accelerated mergers through additional dipole radiation,
and thereby extending the range of masses for which the binary merges within a
Hubble time. The radiation fluxes from an eccentric charged Keplerian binary
are derived using general results for localized periodic sources in flat
spacetime. We find that dipole radiation, although insufficient to fully
resolve the final-parsec problem, can alter the low-frequency spectrum of the
stochastic gravitational-wave background from supermassive black hole binary
inspirals. We construct a simplified model for the spectrum and perform a
Bayesian analysis using the current pulsar timing array data.
