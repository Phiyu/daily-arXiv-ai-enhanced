In $\\alpha$-attractor\nmodels with derivative inflaton couplings, nonlinear amplification of field\nfluctuations drives large spacetime curvature and gravitational collapse\nshortly after inflation ends. Using fully general-relativistic lattice\nsimulations, we find that these dynamics produce black holes with masses of\norder tens of grams at sub-horizon scales, without requiring large primordial\ncurvature perturbations. Although such micro-black holes evaporate rapidly via\nHawking radiation, their formation modifies the post-inflationary equation of\nstate and their evaporation can successfully reheat the Universe before Big\nBang nucleosynthesis. These results identify kinetic preheating as a new,\nefficient channel for black-hole production and establish a direct connection\nbetween inflationary symmetries and strong-gravity phenomena at reheating."}

The results show that\nmergers similar to the LMC consistently generate a significant dipole and a\nsecondary quadrupole response in the halo. The dipole arises from the host\ndensity center displacement and halo distortions, and its amplitude scales as\nthe square of the MW-LMC mass ratio, peaking 0.2-0.7 Gyr after the LMC's\npericenter. The quadrupole's strength depends primarily on the original axis\nratios of the host halo, though contributions from the dynamical friction wake\ncause it to peak less than 0.3 Gyr before pericenter.

These events\nexhibit distinct spatial patterns -- initially concentrated in the inner disk\nat 5 Gyr, expanding outward by 3 Gyr, and becoming widespread with renewed\ncentral activity at 1 Gyr -- likely reflecting changes in spin alignment\nbetween the interacting disks if the enhancements of SF tracks the pericenter\npassages of the SMC to the LMC. The inferred radial migration strength of the\nLMC shows notable enhancements at 0.5, 2, and 5 Gyr.

Our measurements show no\nsignificant tension with the $\\textit{Planck}$ $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In our\nanalysis, we also illustrate that even amongst samples of massive, passive\ngalaxies, the effect of downsizing can clearly be seen."}

Their combination enables disentangling the gas density\nand temperature. In this work, we present the first detection of an angular\ncross-correlation between the ${\\rm DMs}$ and the Compton $y$ parameter of the\ntSZ effect. The theoretical expectation is calculated using the halo model\n$\\texttt{HMx}$, calibrated with hydrodynamic simulations. The observational\ncross-correlation is measured over angular separations of\n$1^\\prime$--$1000^\\prime$ using the ${\\rm DMs}$ from $133$ localized FRBs and\nthe $y$-maps from the Planck satellite and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope\n(ACT). We detect a positive correlation with amplitudes of $\\mathcal{A}=2.26\n\\pm 0.56$ ($4.0 \\sigma$) for Planck and $\\mathcal{A}=1.38 \\pm 0.92$ ($1.5\n\\sigma$) for ACT, where $\\mathcal{A}=1$ corresponds to the theoretical\nprediction of the Planck 2018 $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Assuming an isothermal\ngas, the measured amplitude implies an average electron temperature of $\\approx\n2 \\times 10^7 \\, {\\rm K}$. The correlation is highly sensitive to the matter\nclustering parameter $\\sigma_8$, and its dependence on other cosmological and\nastrophysical parameters -- such as the ionized fraction, the Hubble constant,\nand baryon feedback -- differs from that of the ${\\rm DM}$ alone. This suggests\nthat future joint analyses of the ${\\rm DMs}$ and the tSZ effect could help\nbreak degeneracies among these parameters."}
