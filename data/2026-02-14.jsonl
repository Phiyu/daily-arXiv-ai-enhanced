A slightly modified abstract is presented here due to the arXiv limit", "summary": "Galaxies evolve within vast gaseous halos that fuel star formation and carry signatures of feedback-driven outflows. Deep integral field data have enabled the study of MgII halos, which trace galaxy-scale outflows in emission, but their faintness has limited studies to single-object analyses. Here, we present the first statistical study of MgII-emitting halos using deep MUSE observations of 47 star-forming galaxies at $0.7<z<2.0$. Building on our previous work, where we developed and applied an outflow modeling framework for a single MgII halo, we now extend this approach to a larger sample, enabling robust population-level insights on the properties of circumgalactic outflows traced by their extended MgII emission. We detect extended emission out to tens of kiloparsecs and model the outflows as an ensemble of radially accelerating shells. Galaxies with MgII outflows tend to have higher SFRs, sSFRs, and younger stellar populations, consistent with star-formation-driven winds. The observations are consistent with winds that accelerate linearly with radius, from launching velocities of ~60 km/s up to maximum velocities that correlate with stellar mass and reach ~490 km/s. Their inner regions are highly opaque, and we find a tentative trend between stellar mass and central optical depth. The opening angle of the outflow shows some dependency on the host-galaxy stellar mass, with less massive galaxies showing primarily wide opening angles, and more massive galaxies showing a broader range of values, with both wide and narrow opening angles. The distribution of the spatial extent of MgII halos exhibits a clear peak at half-light radius (HLR) of ~5 kpc, with an extended tail of larger HLR values, up to ~20 kpc. Compact halo sizes (HLR $< 8$ kpc) correlate with stellar mass, but extended halos do not, which could suggest a difference in the powering mechanism between compact and extended halos."}

Multi-probe analyses that incorporate complementary tracers of the gas distribution around haloes offer a pathway to calibrate these effects and recover unbiased cosmological information. In this work, we forecast the constraining power of a joint analysis combining fiducial data from a Stage-IV WL survey with measurements of the dispersion measure from fast radio bursts (FRBs). We evaluate the ability of this approach to simultaneously constrain cosmological parameters and the astrophysical processes governing baryonic feedback, and we quantify the impact of key FRB systematics, including redshift uncertainties and source clustering. We find that, even after accounting for these effects, a 3$\\times$2-point analysis of WL and FRBs significantly improves cosmological constraints, reducing the degradation factor on $S_8$ by $\\sim 80\\%$ compared to WL alone. We further show that FRBs alone are sensitive only to a degenerate combination of the key baryonic parameters, $\\log_{10} M_{\\rm c}$ and $η_{\\rm b}$, and that the inclusion of WL measurements breaks this degeneracy. Finally, we extend our framework to incorporate galaxy clustering measurements using Luminous Red Galaxy and Emission Line Galaxy samples, performing a unified 6$\\times$2-point analysis of WL, dispersion measures of FRBs, and galaxy clustering. While this combined approach tightens constraints on $Ω_{\\rm m}$ and $\\log_{10} M_{\\rm c}$, it does not lead to a significant improvement in $S_8$ constraints beyond those obtained from WL and FRBs alone."}

Heavy fields imprint characteristic oscillatory signals in non-Gaussian correlation functions of the inflaton, a process sometimes referred to as cosmological-collider physics. These distinct signatures are compelling windows into ultra-high-energy physics, but are often suppressed, making standard equilateral non-Gaussianity the most promising discovery channel in many scenarios. In this paper, we show that direct couplings between the inflaton and additional fields can lead to a wide variety of novel, observationally relevant signals which open new parameter regimes that simultaneously exhibit the characteristics of light and heavy fields. We identify these primordial signatures in the late-time observables of the large-scale structure of the Universe, where they most significantly modify the scale-dependent bias of the galaxy power spectrum to include an oscillatory modulation around a non-trivial power law. We explore the full range of parameters that phenomenologically arise in these models and study the sensitivity of current and future galaxy surveys, finding that this new class of primordial non-Gaussianity is particularly accessible in near-term surveys due to its oscillatory feature. Finally, we perform an analysis of existing data from the final release of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS DR12). While we find no evidence for a signal, we demonstrate significant improvements in sensitivity over respective non-oscillatory scenarios and place the first constraints on this extended parameter space of oscillatory non-Gaussianity."}
