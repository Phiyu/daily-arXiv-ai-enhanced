Previous idealized simulations addressing this issue have\nbeen restricted to a small subset of the subhalo orbital parameter space, and\nall assumed subhalos to be isotropic. Here, we present the first extensive\nsimulation suite that quantifies numerical convergence in the tidal evolution\nof anisotropic subhalos under varying numerical resolutions and orbits. We\nreport a universal force resolution criterion: the subhalo's instantaneous\ntidal radius must always be resolved by at least 20 cells in adaptive mesh\nrefinement (AMR)-based simulations, or by 20 softening lengths (Plummer\nequivalent) in tree-based simulations, regardless of refinement details or\nsubhalo physical properties such as concentration or velocity anisotropy. We\nalso report a universal expression for the discreteness-noise-driven scatter in\nthe bound-mass fraction of subhalos that depends only on the subhalo mass\nresolution at infall and the instantaneous bound mass fraction, agnostic of any\nfurther subhalo properties. Such stochastic discreteness noise causes both\npremature disruption and, notably, spurious survival of poorly mass-resolved\nsubhalos. We demonstrate that as many as 50 percent of all subhalos in\nstate-of-the-art cosmological simulations are likely to be either force and/or\nmass unresolved.

The\nionic transitions of heavy elements in quasar spectra can probe both the\nmechanisms and the sources of chemical pollution, but high resolution, high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectra are required, as the IGM absorbers can be\ntoo weak for direct detection. In this work, we investigate the IGM\nmetallicity, focusing on the detection of the weak absorption lines. We\nexploited the cosmological tool of the two-point correlation function (TPCF)\nand applied it to the transmitted flux in the CIV forest of the ultra-high S/N\nUVES spectrum of the quasar HE0940-1050 (z~3). We also \"deabsorbed\" the\nstrongest circum-galactic medium (CGM) systems to reveal the underlying IGM\nsignal. For each test, we generated 1000 mock spectra with shuffled line\npositions to derive an estimate for the TPCF noise level. The TPCF shows a\nclear peak at the characteristic velocity separation of the CIV doublet, but\nwhen deabsorbing the CGM contribution (i.e. all metal lines and CIV lines\nassociated with logN(HI)>14.0), the peak is no longer significant at 1$\\sigma$,\nalthough 7 weak CIV systems remain visible. Even adding up to 135 additional\nweak mock CIV systems (logN(HI)<14.0) to the spectrum does not produce a\nsignificant CIV peak. Eventually, when we create a synthetic spectrum with\ngaussian distributed noise and same S/N as the complete spectrum, we remove the\nsignal caused by the spectral intrinsic features and thus find a peak\ncompatible with a metallicity of -3.80<[C/H]<-3.50. We conclude that the TPCF\nmethod is not sensitive to the presence of the weakest systems in the real\nspectrum, despite the extremely high S/N and high resolution of the data.\nHowever, the results of this statistical technique would possibly change when\ncombining more than one line of sight."}

It introduces a novel framework, named spinfoam\nstack, to systematically sum spinfoam amplitudes over an infinite class of\n2-complexes. These complexes are generated by stacking an arbitrary number of\nfaces upon a simpler root complex. The central result is obtained by analyzing\nthe amplitude of spinfoam stack in the limit where an upper cut-off on the area\nof internal faces is taken to infinity. In this limit, the amplitude as an\nintegral localizes via a stationary phase mechanism onto a critical manifold.\nThis manifold is shown to be the space of SU(2) flat connections on the\nunderlying complex. This localization effectively reduces the bulk dynamics\nfrom a theory of quantum geometry to a topological theory akin to SU(2) BF\ntheory. For spinfoams on topologically trivial manifolds, this result has a\npowerful consequence: the spinfoam stack amplitude factorizes into a\ntriangulation-dependent normalization factor and a finite part that depends\nonly on the boundary data. Renormalizing the amplitude yields a finite result\nthat is manifestly independent of the bulk structure of the 2-complex. This\nprovides a concrete realization of triangulation independence in a well-defined\nlimit, suggesting the possibility of existing a non-trivial fixed point of\nquantum gravity within the spinfoam formalism."}

After applying this filter, cloud properties remain consistent across\ngalaxies, though some clouds in NGC 5236 show elevated velocity dispersions,\nlikely due to environmental effects.

The\nsimulation follows 4.2 trillion dark matter particles in a comoving box of\n$2.5\\ h^{-1}{\\rm Gpc}$, with a mass resolution of $3.2 \\times 10^8\\, {\\rm\nM}_{\\odot}$ and a force resolution of $3.0\\ h^{-1}{\\rm kpc}$. Its combination\nof scale and resolution is ideal for studying large-scale structures and rare\ncosmic objects. In this first paper of the HM project, we explore whether the\nmassive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 (A2744) can be reproduced in detail in the\nsimulation. Pixel-based statistics of galaxy number density $N_{\\rm gal}$,\nluminosity density $L_{\\rm gal}$, and projected mass density $\\kappa$ show\nexcellent agreement between A2744 and its analogues down to $\\sim 50\\ {\\rm\nkpc}$, once field-selection biases toward high galaxy surface density are\naccounted for. This concordance, achieved in one of the most extreme known\ngalaxy environments, is a validation of the underlying $\\Lambda{\\rm CDM}$ model\nin the extreme regime of A2744 and showcases the robustness and accuracy of the\nHM simulation, which is capable of producing galaxy and mass catalogues of\ncomparable quality out to high redshift across its full comoving volume of $45$\n${\\rm Gpc^3}$."}
