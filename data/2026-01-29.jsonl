These theories produce a constraint equation that follows from the modified Einstein's equations and the contracted Bianchi identity which has no simple solution and raises questions about the consistency of backgrounds structures in extensions to general relativity. In contrast, spontaneous symmetry breaking where fields acquire a vacuum expectation value are shown to avoid these problems. Nevertheless, there are some approaches that consistently implement explicit diffeomorphism breaking by: i) introducing geometrical restrictions which may dynamically restore diffeomorphism invariance, ii) using the Stückelberg formalism where auxiliary scalar fields can carry degrees of freedom associated to spontaneously broken symmetries, and more recently by iii) exploiting the isometries of a given gravitational configuration in the presence of a background; which ultimately requires the background fields to be Lie-dragged along the Killing vectors. In this work, we further develop and apply the latter approach focusing on a concrete example involving the Gödel metric and the minimal gravitational Standard-Model Extension. We show that the resulting dynamics is fully consistent with the constraint equation and produce new Noether's identities. Furthermore we investigate causality violations by analyzing the critical radius, which is found to depend explicitly on the background fields. This dependence allows for the emergence of both causal and non-causal regions in spacetime."}

The solution depends, beyond mass and charge, on a Lorentz-violating parameter, a ModMax deformation parameter, and a discrete branch selector $ζ=\\pm1$. We show that the ordinary branch admits extremal and non-extremal configurations, while the phantom branch generically supports a single-horizon geometry. Black-hole thermodynamics is analyzed within the Tsallis non-extensive framework, revealing branch-dependent stability and Joule-Thomson behavior. Weak gravitational lensing, photon propagation in plasma, and tidal forces are then studied, revealing clear optical and strong-field signatures that distinguish the two branches. In particular, the ordinary branch exhibits finite-radius tidal inversion, absent in the phantom sector. Our results demonstrate that the combined Kalb-Ramond and ModMax effects lead to a rich and observationally distinguishable black-hole phenomenology."}

Known models of inflation, like the Starobinsky model, the Higgs model and the $a$-attractors are at least $2σ$ off the ACT data. In this work we aim to provide a top-to-bottom approach in single scalar field inflationary cosmology compatible with the ACT data. Specifically, inspired by the fact that the Starobinsky model, the Higgs model and the $a$-attractors, all being plateau potentials, result to the same attractor relation between the spectral index of scalar perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which is of the form $n_s(r)=1-αr^{1/2}$, in this work we seek for attractors of the form $n_s(r)=f(r)$ that may lead to ACT-compatible inflation. Specifically, we fix the function $f(r)$ to have a specific desirable form and then solve the differential equation $n_s(r)=f(r)$ to find the potential which results to the relation $n_s(r)=f(r)$. We discovered analytically three classes of potentials which are variants of the general form $n_s(r)=γ\\pm βr \\pm r^{1/2}$ and all these models are found to be compatible with the ACT data."}

In this work we investigate how to realize a smooth transition between a slow-roll and a power-law inflationary regime in the context of single scalar field inflation. As we show it is possible to realize such a smooth transition by generalizing the kinetic energy of single scalar field in the form $\\dotφ^2=β(φ)V(φ)$, where $β(φ)$ is some appropriate function of the scalar field. Using two distinct approaches we show that it is possible to realize a smooth transition from a slow-roll to a power-law inflationary regime, and the two approaches produce identical results regarding the slow-roll regime. Also we show that the slow-roll regime is quite short, about $N\\sim 30$ $e$-foldings, with the flatness and horizon problems being solved with the synergistic effect of the two inflationary patches. The slow-roll era is found to be compatible with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope data."}

Studying their progenitors, proto-clusters, sheds light on the earliest stages of cluster formation. Yet, detecting proto-clusters is demanding: their member galaxies are loosely bound and the emerging hot intracluster medium (ICM) may only be in the initial stages of virialization. Recent JWST observations located several proto-cluster candidates by identifying overdensities of $z\\gtrsim5$ galaxies. However, none of these candidates was detected by X-ray observations, which offer a powerful way to unveil the hot ICM. Here, we report the combined Chandra and JWST detection of a proto-cluster, JADES-ID1, at $z\\approx5.68$, merely one billion years after the Big Bang. We measure a bolometric X-ray luminosity of $L_{\\rm bol} = (1.5^{+0.5}_{-0.6}) \\times10^{44} \\ \\rm{erg \\ s^{-1}}$ and infer a total gravitating mass of $M_{500}= (1.8^{+0.6}_{-0.7}) \\times 10^{13} \\ \\rm{M_{\\odot}}$, making this system a progenitor of today's most massive galaxy clusters. The detection of extended, shock-heated gas indicates that substantial ICM heating can occur in massive halos as early as $z\\approx5.7$. In addition, given the limited survey volume, the discovery of such a massive cluster is statistically unlikely, implying that the formation of the large-scale structure must have occurred more rapidly in some regions of the early universe than standard cosmological models predict."}

The observations were taken as part of a pilot project for the MAJORS large program at the JCMT telescope. By incorporating prior knowledge of N(H$_2$) and $T_K$, assuming a constant density, and using the RADEX radiative transfer code we found that the HCN and HCO$^+$ abundances range from $X$(HCN) = $0.4-7.0 \\times 10^{-8}$ and $X$(HCO$^+$) = $0.4-7.3 \\times 10^{-9}$. Additional modelling using the NAUTILUS chemical evolution code, that takes H$_2$ density variations into account, however, suggests the HCN and HCO$^+$ abundances may be fairly constant. Careful modelling of three different positions finds $X$(HCN) = $1.3-1.7 \\times 10^{-8}$, $X$(HCO$^+$) = $1.3-3.1 \\times 10^{-9}$. Cross-comparison of the two models also provides a crude estimate of the gas density producing the HCN and HCO$^+$ emission, with H$_2$ densities in the range $5 \\times 10^4 - 5 \\times 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, suggesting that the HCN and HCO$^+$ emission does indeed arise from dense gas. High UV intensity (e.g. $G_o >$ a few thousand) has no effect on the abundances in regions where the visual extinction is large enough to effectively shield the gas from the UV field. In regions where $A_V < 6$, however, the abundance of both species is lowered due to destructive reactions with species that are directly affected by the radiation field."}

The radius dependent effective equation of state of the self-interacting dark matter model we shall introduce is assumed to be an isothermal equation of state of the form $P(r)=K(r)\\left(\\frac{ρ(r)}{ρ_{\\star}}\\right)$, where the energy density will have the form $ρ(r)=\\frac{ρ_0}{\\left( 1+\\frac{r^2}{α^2}\\right)^{5/2}}$, while the entropy function $K(r)$ is $K(r)=\\frac{K_0}{\\left( 1+\\frac{r^2}{α^2}\\right)^{1/2}}$. The resulting model is confronted in detail with the SPARC galaxy data and 175 galaxies are used and tested. It proves that the analytic model can successfully produce the rotation curves of 116 galaxies, most of which are small mass spirals, irregular galaxies, low-surface-brightness and low-luminosity spirals and dwarf galaxies. On the other hand, 59 galaxies cannot be successfully described by our analytic model. We tested statistically the correlation between the parameter $K_0$ of the entropy function corresponding to the viable galaxies, and the flat rotation velocity $V_{flat}$ and the maximum rotation velocity $V_{max}$ of the galaxies from the SPARC data. We also examined the baryon mass $M_b$-$K_0$ relation and the luminosity $L$-$K_0$ relation. We have been able to produce the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation for the viable galaxies, directly from the correlation $K_0$-$M_b$ and $K_0$-$V_{flat}$, with the resulting relation being $M_b\\sim V_{flat}^{4.026 \\pm 0.371}$, however we failed to produce the canonical Tully-Fisher relation."}

Working in the Einstein frame, we consider a spatially flat FLRW universe filled with pressureless matter and a universally coupled dilaton. Expanding the conformal coupling function and the scalar potential around the least-coupling point, we obtain a closed and self-consistent autonomous system governing the late-time evolution of the scalar-matter sector. The resulting phase space contains a stable fixed point associated with least coupling, approached only asymptotically along cosmological trajectories. Therefore, at any finite epoch the solution typically retains a small displacement from the fixed point. In the DP regime this finite-epoch displacement sets the ambient coupling, and thus determines the magnitude of fifth-force effects and deviations from the equivalence principle in the nonrelativistic limit. By linearising the system around a finite-epoch reference state, we show that the damping of the displacement is controlled by the Jacobian eigenvalues of the DP fixed point. This yields a direct dynamical estimate of how rapidly deviations from the equivalence principle are reduced during cosmological evolution. The mechanism is global and cosmological in origin, and is conceptually distinct from local environmental screening as in chameleon or symmetron scenarios. Overall, our results illustrate how phase-space techniques provide a clear bridge between cosmological dynamics and weak-field departures from General Relativity."}

We observe a significant decline in R3 values below Muv > -18, which we interpret as evidence of decreasing metallicities in fainter regimes. We explore four prescription models of the evolution of R3 with UV emission based on the new measurements and results from previous surveys. Applying these models to the GLIMPSE [O III]+Hb luminosity functions, we measure and extrapolate the ionising photon production rate $\\dot{N}_{ion}$ of galaxies down to very faint limits SFR(Ha) > 5e-3 Msun/yr. Our results support the dominant contribution of star-forming galaxies to reionisation, and are consistent with the recent discovery of ultra-faint metal-poor galaxies. Our measurements of the relative contribution of each luminosity bin show that galaxies with L(Ha)~1e41 to 1e42 erg/s dominate at 8<z<9, but the relative contributions become more uniform at $7<z<8$.

Within this dual description, the operator-ordering ambiguity parameter appears as the azimuthal quantum number of the hydrogen atom. A skewed Bohr correspondence emerges for the bound states, matching classical evolution at large volumes but deviating near the bounce. By constructing wave packets from these bound states, we demonstrate that the classical Big Bang and Big Crunch singularities are resolved, and the universe oscillates between quantum bounces and classical turnaround points. The expectation values of the observables indicate a cyclic universe -- with vanishing Hubble parameter at turnarounds -- undergoing quantum bounces. This exactly solvable model offers a tractable setting to explore quantum gravitational effects in cosmology. We analyze the properties of this cyclic universe, contrasting its bound-state dynamics with the scattering states of the de Sitter case."}

Leveraging the ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of a gravitational lensing field of Abell S1063, taken as part of the GLIMPSE survey, we present spectroscopic properties of 16 galaxies fainter than $M_{\\rm UV}=-17$ mag, including the metallicity, dust attenuation, and the ionizing photon production efficiency. The emission lines are generally quite strong, roughly half of which cannot be replicated with standard stellar populations and require an extreme ionizing source. We also identify relatively strong [OIII] emission lines from all sample galaxies, which indicates that the low-mass end of the mass-metallicity relation is extended down to $M_\\star\\sim10^6\\ M_\\odot$ at $z\\sim6$. The strong [OIII] line detection from the lowest-mass galaxy among the sample ($M_\\star\\sim10^{5.6}\\ M_\\odot$) stands in contrast to recent reports of extremely metal-poor galaxy candidates at similar mass and redshift, suggesting that there could be two distinct pathways of the earliest metal enrichment as simulations have predicted. Interestingly, we detect both dust attenuation and galactic outflow in one of the sample galaxies with $M_\\star=10^{6.6}\\ M_\\odot$ at $z=5.5$. All the dust, metal, and outflow contents in this galaxy can be consistently explained by supernovae (SNe), indicative of the key roles of SNe in the earliest galaxy assembly such as dust production, metal enrichment, stellar feedback, and baryon cycle."}

Using the tunnelling formalism, we obtain a modified Hawking temperature different from previous works due to the quantum gravity effect for the charged Dirac particle at the HNKNK AdS black hole's horizon. We find that the modified Hawking temperature is affected by the cosmological constant, magnetic mass, electric and magnetic charges. We demonstrate that a significant number of discontinuities exist in the heat capacities of the HNKNK AdS, indicating that the black hole system becomes unstable as the black hole size decreases."}

Ferreira"], "title": "Apparent Dark-Energy Evolution from Cosmic Inhomogeneities", "comment": "Submitted, comments welcome", "summary": "A mildly inhomogeneous universe with a cosmological constant may look like it contains evolving dark energy. We show that could be the case by modelling the inhomogeneities and their effects in three different ways: as clumped matter surrounded by voids, as back-reaction of small-scale structure on the overall expansion of the Universe, and, finally, as a large-scale curvature inhomogeneity. In all of these cases, the propagation of light is affected, and differs from that in a homogeneous and isotropic universe. The net result is that cosmological observables, such as angular diameter and luminosity distances, become distorted. We find, in all three models, that the inclusion of these effects pushes the distance-redshift relation towards closer agreement with recent data from both supernovae Ia from the Dark Energy Survey, and from baryon acoustic oscillations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. The amount of inhomogeneity in these models might not be enough to explain the entirety of the deviation from a cosmological constant, but is found to be of a similar order of magnitude, hinting that these data may be consistent with a universe dominated by a cosmological constant."}

While COMs were once expected to be efficiently destroyed under UV-irradiated conditions, detections in photodissociation regions (PDRs) have challenged this view. However, the mechanisms by which UV radiation contributes to their formation are still uncertain. Here, we present moderately resolved maps of simple and complex organic molecules at the UV-illuminated edge of the Horsehead nebula, obtained by combining ALMA and IRAM 30m single-dish observations at $\\sim 15^{\\prime\\prime}$ resolution. We analyze the spatial distribution of species such as C$^{17}$O, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, CH$_3$CN, and HC$_3$N. By incorporating previous C$^{17}$O and C$^{18}$O single-dish data as well as PdBI maps of H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH, we derive profiles of gas density, temperature, thermal pressure, and column densities of the organic species as a function of distance from the UV source. Our results show that most organic species$-$particularly H$_2$CO, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, and CH$_3$CN$-$exhibit enhanced column densities at the UV-illuminated edge compared to cloud interiors, possibly indicating efficient dust-grain surface chemistry driven by the diffusion of atomic C and radicals produced via photodissociation of CO and CH$_3$OH, as supported by recent laboratory experiments. The exceptions, HC$_3$N and CH$_3$OH, can be attributed to inefficient formation on dust grains and ineffective non-thermal desorption into the gas phase, respectively. Additionally, contributions from gas-phase hydrocarbon photochemistry$-$possibly seeded by grain-surface products$-$cannot be ruled out. Further chemical modeling is needed to confirm the efficiency of these pathways for the studied species, which could have important implications for other cold, UV-irradiated environments such as protoplanetary disks."}

We analytically investigate the violation of the LGI in the context of photon-graviton conversion in a magnetic field background, motivated by its potential applications to testing the nonclassicality of gravity. When gravitational perturbations are quantized as gravitons, the conversion of an initial single photon state gives rise to a superposition of photon and graviton states. We show that the temporal correlations obtained from successive projective measurements on the photon-graviton system violate the LGI. Observation of such a violation would provide a novel avenue for probing the quantum nature of gravity."}

We test two scenarios for training: (1) on the data vectors and (2) on the full $κ$-maps.

The present-day metallicity structure encodes the imprint of the Galaxy's formation, assembly, and secular evolution. Using oxygen abundances from HII regions across the MW disk, together with MW-mass galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) cosmological simulations, we show that $\\ell$-$v$ diagrams trace radial metallicity gradients and non-axisymmetric azimuthal metallicity variations. Because they do not rely on distance measurements, $\\ell$-$v$ diagrams complement face-on maps for studying metallicity structure. In the MW, we detect the radial metallicity gradient in $\\ell$-$v$ space, but current HII region oxygen abundance errors are too high to reveal azimuthal variations. In the FIRE-2 MW-mass galaxies, the radial gradient is evident in $\\ell$-$v$ diagrams regardless of observer location, but anomalous gas kinematics can mimic azimuthal metallicity variations. We term these \"anomalous motions\", which have an excess local standard of rest (LSR) velocity tail 3 times larger in the FIRE-2 simulations compared to the MW. Our results highlight $\\ell$-$v$ diagrams as a largely unexplored tool for probing metallicity structure without requiring distances, and underscore discrepancies between the gas kinematics in the FIRE-2 simulations and those in the MW."}

Determining the local mass density and velocity distribution is the aim of the CosmicFlows project. An alternate approach is based on catalogs of galaxies, supplemented with some scheme for filling in for unseen galaxies. Here, we compare the density field proposed by Biteau (2021) with the quasi-linear density field of CosmicFlows2 (Hoffman et al. 2018) and the mean posterior field of CosmicFlows4 (Valade 2026). We find factor-two level differences in some regions and even greater in regions toward the Galactic center zone of avoidance (ZoA) (|l| < 30°, |b| < 20°) as filled by Biteau using \"cloning\". Within 11 Mpc the density field is well-determined by the Local Volume catalog (Karachentsev et al. 2018) which Biteau directly incorporates; at larger distances, Biteau (2021) should not be used in the ZoA where \"galaxies\" are entirely fictitious but otherwise is to be preferred over CosmicFlows emphasizing the direction and integrated mass of structures; the radial distribution of mass in Biteau (2021) is less robust due to line-of-sight peculiar velocities. The angular positions of structures in CosmicFlows are sometimes not congruent with evidence in the galaxy catalog."}

Since star formation is expected to be fed by external gas accretion, the knowledge about the circumgalactic media (CGM) of these galaxies is essential to understanding how they quench. In this work, we present the discovery of a massive and passive galaxy ($M_\\star\\simeq10^{11}\\,M_\\odot$) within the MQN01 structure at z~3.25, containing one of the largest overdensities of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) found so far at $z\\gtrsim3$. The passive galaxy has a star-formation rate of $4^{+6}_{-2}~M_\\odot$/yr, placing it more than 1 dex below the star-forming main sequence, and has no detectable molecular gas ($M_\\mathrm{H2}<7\\times10^{9}\\,M_\\odot$). Surprisingly, it is located at the center of a large cool gas reservoir, as traced by bright Ly$α$ and H$α$ emission. By taking advantage of deep multi-wavelength information unique to this field, including deep Chandra X-ray data, we argue that the inefficient gas accretion from the CGM onto this galaxy over the last few hundreds of Myr, as suggested by the observations, could be caused by an AGN jet of a nearby star-forming galaxy located at a projected distance of 48 kpc. In particular, we argue that the jet feedback may have maintained a high level of CGM turbulence around the passive galaxy and thus caused a reduced gas accretion over the required time-scales. In addition, the elevated ionizing field provided by the AGN overdensity, including the nearby AGN, can illuminate the passive galaxy's cool CGM and make it visible through fluorescent emission. Our study demonstrates that the star formation rates of high-redshift galaxies could be substantially reduced and maintained at a low level even within gas-rich and overdense environments in particular situations."}

A rigorous gauge-invariant formalism is employed to analyze gravitational perturbations of the extended Schwarzschild metric. The central finding is a critical pathology within the polar perturbation sector, where metric fluctuations couple to the theory's fundamental line element field. This coupling is governed by a factor that, while well-behaved at the horizon, diverges powerfully in the far-field limit as a direct consequence of the theory's non-asymptotically flat nature. This indicates a strong infrared instability that overwhelms perturbations at large distances. In stark contrast, the axial perturbation sector is found to be completely stable. This dichotomy proves that the instability is not inherent to the background metric but is specifically generated by the novel coupling mechanism encoding MGR's unified dark sectors. The results reveal a fundamental strong-coupling problem within the MGR framework, challenging its physical viability as an alternative to Einstein's General Relativity (EGR)."}

In preparation for the forthcoming analysis of the Euclid spectroscopic data, we investigate three approaches to modelling RSD effects on the power spectrum multipoles of mock H$α$ emission line galaxies. We focus on two one-loop perturbation theory models -- the effective field theory (EFT) and velocity difference generator (${\\rm VDG_ \\infty}$) -- which differ in their treatment of the real-to-redshift space mapping on small scales, and a third approach, the BACCO emulator, which adopts a hybrid strategy combining perturbation theory with high-resolution N-body simulations.

Our analysis uses the correspondence with the stellar velocity field to split the complex emission line profiles of the CO(1-0) line into components in gravitational and non-gravitational motion. We find a massive ($8\\times10^{9}\\,M_\\odot$) molecular outflow containing about 40% of the total molecular gas mass in the system. The outflow shows a bi-conical morphology centered on the brightest galaxy in the merger, oriented along its minor axis and extending to $\\sim5\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$. This outflow has a characteristic velocity of $170\\,\\mathrm{km/s}$, an outflow mass rate of $700\\,M_\\odot/\\mathrm{yr}$, a depletion time of $16\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$, and energetics consistent with star formation as a driver. The neutral atomic and ionized gas phases traced by NaI absorption and H$α$ emission show counterparts to the blueshifted cold molecular outflow but are only 15% and 3% as massive. None of the three gas phases show any signs of slowing down over the extent at which we detected the outflow, suggesting an acceleration mechanism acting on the outflowing gas at kiloparsec scales. We also detect $3.5\\times 10^7\\,M_\\odot$ of dust, traced by optical extinction in the MUSE data, in the blueshifted outflowing cold molecular gas. The ionization state of the non-outflowing gas is consistent with star formation, while the outflowing component shows shock-like ionization. We conclude that the multiphase outflow in IRAS20100-4156 originates in the southeast nucleus of the merger and is driven by the starburst activity there, with radiation pressure likely playing a significant role in its acceleration."}

Known models of inflation, like the Starobinsky model, the Higgs model and the $a$-attractors are at least $2σ$ off the ACT data. In this work we aim to provide a top-to-bottom approach in single scalar field inflationary cosmology compatible with the ACT data. Specifically, inspired by the fact that the Starobinsky model, the Higgs model and the $a$-attractors, all being plateau potentials, result to the same attractor relation between the spectral index of scalar perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which is of the form $n_s(r)=1-αr^{1/2}$, in this work we seek for attractors of the form $n_s(r)=f(r)$ that may lead to ACT-compatible inflation. Specifically, we fix the function $f(r)$ to have a specific desirable form and then solve the differential equation $n_s(r)=f(r)$ to find the potential which results to the relation $n_s(r)=f(r)$. We discovered analytically three classes of potentials which are variants of the general form $n_s(r)=γ\\pm βr \\pm r^{1/2}$ and all these models are found to be compatible with the ACT data."}

We derive stellar masses and specific star formation rates using Prospector fits to UV-MIR broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 42 TDE hosts, together with a high-mass comparison sample, and combine these with SMBH mass estimates from the literature. We first verify our approach by reproducing the established result that quenched galaxies host more massive SMBHs than star-forming systems at fixed stellar mass, a result widely interpreted as evidence for SMBH growth driving the blue-to-red sequence transition. However, examining the TDE sample in isolation reveals a trend reversal at lower masses, uncovering a surprising population of low-mass ($10^{9.6} \\lesssim M_{\\rm gal} \\lesssim 10^{10.5}$ M$_\\odot$), quenched galaxies hosting SMBHs systematically less massive ($M_{\\rm BH} \\lesssim 10^{6.5}$ M$_\\odot$) than those in star-forming galaxies of comparable stellar mass. After ruling out degeneracies in our SED fits, we conclude that this reflects a physical difference in the quenching mechanism between these TDE hosts and the more massive galaxies. This is unlikely to be driven by AGN feedback, and could instead result from environmental processes, which can end star formation and hinder SMBH growth. We also show that the quenched and post-starburst population within the TDE sample is likely under-represented due to selection biases, suggesting the true fraction could be even higher than observed."}

In model~I, a Bondi-type mass model described by the asymptotic mass $μ_c$, horizon mass $μ_H$, and profile slope $λ$, it is found that the absorption cross section increases with steeper $λ$, larger $μ_c$ (especially at higher frequencies), or smaller $μ_H$. The differential scattering cross section in this model shows the strongest dependence on the horizon mass $μ_H$. When $μ_H$ exceeds a critical value for a fixed incoming wave frequency $ω$, no partial wave transmits into the black hole, flattening the differential scattering cross section as a function of angle before it increases again with further increase of $μ_H$. Model~II, which considers a truncated accretion region outside some radius $r_0$, contains a potential well in its effective scattering potential. Its absorption cross section decreases in the low-frequency region as the accretion radius $r_0$ decreases, and more importantly, it shows resonance peaks at the quasibound wave frequencies due to resonances induced by the potential well. The differential scattering cross sections show dips around intermediate scattering angles when the parameters (mainly $μ_H$ and $ω$) are such that the resonantly scattered and non-resonant waves interfere destructively around these angles. In both models, absorption exhibits a zero-absorption band as $ω$ approaches $μ_c$ from above, and in both absorption and scattering, the effects of the parameters are found to diminish in the high-frequency limit."}

In this work we investigate how to realize a smooth transition between a slow-roll and a power-law inflationary regime in the context of single scalar field inflation. As we show it is possible to realize such a smooth transition by generalizing the kinetic energy of single scalar field in the form $\\dotφ^2=β(φ)V(φ)$, where $β(φ)$ is some appropriate function of the scalar field. Using two distinct approaches we show that it is possible to realize a smooth transition from a slow-roll to a power-law inflationary regime, and the two approaches produce identical results regarding the slow-roll regime. Also we show that the slow-roll regime is quite short, about $N\\sim 30$ $e$-foldings, with the flatness and horizon problems being solved with the synergistic effect of the two inflationary patches.

One candidate mechanism is rotational emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which can have the necessary electric dipole moment and size distribution to account for the AME in representative interstellar environments. However, previous investigations have found that AME is better correlated with the far-infrared dust emission rather than the PAH emission. In this work we analyze the correlations between the AME and the PAH and far-infrared dust emission using the 3.3 $μ$m PAH emission feature as observed by band 3 of the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE). This analysis builds on previous work conducted in individual molecular clouds and extends it into fainter, more diffuse structures. In addition, we utilize the COSMOGLOBE DIRBE reduction for this work, building on previous studies that used the original DIRBE data set. We find that the AME is better correlated with far-infrared dust emission ($ρ\\sim$0.9) than the PAH emission ($ρ\\sim$0.7) in the central $|b|\\leq$ 10\\degree\\ region of the sky. This could indicate either that non-PAH dust grains or an alternative physical emission mechanism is primarily responsible for the AME in the Galactic Plane, or that the excitation conditions for mid-infrared emission and for AME from PAHs differ substantially."}

A crucial aspect of our analysis is the recognition that the apparent horizon volume is not comoving; this requires a consistent accounting of particle exchange across the moving boundary. We demonstrate that the evolution of the particle number, and explicitly the matter entropy, can be decomposed into two distinct physical contributions: genuine bulk particle production and a net flux induced by the dynamics of the horizon itself. Finally, we derive the Generalized Second Law (GSL) in this setting, showing transparently how the total entropy budget is balanced by horizon thermodynamics, bulk creation, and boundary fluxes."}

We investigate the spatial clustering properties of 225,382 quasars from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) within the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) Data Release 2 footprint, split by the statistically-calculated fraction of their radio flux densities contributed by jets (relative to the contribution from star formation). We find a positive correlation between the clustering strengths of quasars and their jet fraction, where quasars with a higher jet fraction have a higher clustering amplitude measured by their two-point correlation functions. We show that this correlation is unlikely related to differences in BH masses or bolometric luminosities. Quasars dominated by powerful jet activities generally reside in dark matter haloes $10-100$ times more massive than those without strong jets, with typical halo masses of $10^{13-14}\\ h^{-1}M_\\odot$, establishing a robust link between powerful AGN jets and rich cluster environments. Our results demonstrate that halo mass is important for determining the power of radio jets, but suggest that there is no minimum dark matter halo mass or BH mass required for the triggering of jets. The observed correlation suggests that BH spin is likely to play a minor role in jet production; instead, the key driver could be the presence of a strong magnetic flux."}

Working in the Einstein frame, we consider a spatially flat FLRW universe filled with pressureless matter and a universally coupled dilaton. Expanding the conformal coupling function and the scalar potential around the least-coupling point, we obtain a closed and self-consistent autonomous system governing the late-time evolution of the scalar-matter sector. The resulting phase space contains a stable fixed point associated with least coupling, approached only asymptotically along cosmological trajectories. Therefore, at any finite epoch the solution typically retains a small displacement from the fixed point. In the DP regime this finite-epoch displacement sets the ambient coupling, and thus determines the magnitude of fifth-force effects and deviations from the equivalence principle in the nonrelativistic limit. By linearising the system around a finite-epoch reference state, we show that the damping of the displacement is controlled by the Jacobian eigenvalues of the DP fixed point. This yields a direct dynamical estimate of how rapidly deviations from the equivalence principle are reduced during cosmological evolution. The mechanism is global and cosmological in origin, and is conceptually distinct from local environmental screening as in chameleon or symmetron scenarios. Overall, our results illustrate how phase-space techniques provide a clear bridge between cosmological dynamics and weak-field departures from General Relativity."}

While the positive $Λ$ sector [1] yields a continuous spectrum and a single bounce, we show here that the negative $Λ$ sector leads to a discrete spectrum of energy eigenvalues, effectively quantizing the cosmological constant. Within this dual description, the operator-ordering ambiguity parameter appears as the azimuthal quantum number of the hydrogen atom. A skewed Bohr correspondence emerges for the bound states, matching classical evolution at large volumes but deviating near the bounce. By constructing wave packets from these bound states, we demonstrate that the classical Big Bang and Big Crunch singularities are resolved, and the universe oscillates between quantum bounces and classical turnaround points. The expectation values of the observables indicate a cyclic universe -- with vanishing Hubble parameter at turnarounds -- undergoing quantum bounces. This exactly solvable model offers a tractable setting to explore quantum gravitational effects in cosmology. We analyze the properties of this cyclic universe, contrasting its bound-state dynamics with the scattering states of the de Sitter case."}

We use proper motions combined with backward orbit integration in a semi-analytic potential to constrain plausible interaction scenarios for Pisces and And XVI. Both dwarfs are currently M31 satellites, defined as being inside its virial radius. However, our results show that, in our fiducial mass models, 42% (And XVI) and 60% (Pisces) of dwarf orbits support that they were previously satellites of M33 (i.e., once inside its virial radius). Both dwarfs had fly-by encounters with M33 at relative velocities greater than M33's escape speed within the past 1-2 Gyr. In over 70% of orbits, Pisces and And XVI also had a close approach with each other post-M33 interaction and share an orbital plane, suggesting possible past group accretion. We explore a range of mass combinations for M31 and M33, finding that this primarily regulates the likelihood that the dwarfs were satellites of M33 in the past, while upholding conclusions of recent flybys about M33. These close interactions provide new evidence for past satellite exchange and/or group infall scenarios between M31 and M33. Such interactions also affect comparisons to observational surveys that define satellites primarily by their distance relative to host galaxies."}

We show that could be the case by modelling the inhomogeneities and their effects in three different ways: as clumped matter surrounded by voids, as back-reaction of small-scale structure on the overall expansion of the Universe, and, finally, as a large-scale curvature inhomogeneity. In all of these cases, the propagation of light is affected, and differs from that in a homogeneous and isotropic universe. The net result is that cosmological observables, such as angular diameter and luminosity distances, become distorted. We find, in all three models, that the inclusion of these effects pushes the distance-redshift relation towards closer agreement with recent data from both supernovae Ia from the Dark Energy Survey, and from baryon acoustic oscillations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. The amount of inhomogeneity in these models might not be enough to explain the entirety of the deviation from a cosmological constant, but is found to be of a similar order of magnitude, hinting that these data may be consistent with a universe dominated by a cosmological constant."}

Specifically, the contribution from low-mass stars, which make up the bulk of stellar mass, is not directly observed, but inferred based on an extrapolation of the MW IMF. Here, we provide the first robust measurements of the IMF beyond the local Universe. Using ultra-deep spectra of nine massive, quiescent galaxies at $z\\sim0.7$ from the ambitious JWST-IMFERNO program, extended to bluer wavelengths with deep spectra from LEGA-C [8], we find that these distant galaxies have excess low-mass stars.

Recent JWST observations located several proto-cluster candidates by identifying overdensities of $z\\gtrsim5$ galaxies. However, none of these candidates was detected by X-ray observations, which offer a powerful way to unveil the hot ICM.
