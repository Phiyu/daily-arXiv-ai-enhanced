For HCN, HCO$^{+}$, and HNC, we identified two distinct absorption components that are common to both transitions, whereas a single component was detected in the isotopologue spectra. In this paper, we accurately evaluate the excitation temperatures and their uncertainties from the absorption strengths of these components, and use them to determine the CMB temperature. Uncertainties in the continuum covering factor were propagated into the excitation temperature via Monte Carlo sampling. We further corrected the observed optical depths for biases due to column-density nonuniformity by assuming a lognormal column-density distribution. Under the assumption that the rotational levels are in radiative equilibrium with the cosmic microwave background (CMB), we derived excitation temperature profiles in the optically thin regime. Because the excitation of HCO$^+$ is biased by an additional velocity component and partial collisional excitation, this species was excluded from the final determination of the CMB temperature. From a weighted mean of the excitation temperatures obtained from HCN and HNC, we determined the CMB temperature at $z\\!=\\!0.68$ to be ${4.50\\pm0.17\\,\\mathrm{K}}$. This constitutes the first measurement of the CMB temperature at $z\\!=\\!0.68$ based on a quasar absorption line system and represents the most precise determination at this redshift, highly consistent with the standard Big Bang cosmological model."}

Because observable consequences of their existence have only recently been seriously considered, there have been relatively few constraints on their abundance. This work motivates a simple yet powerful constraint on SLABs: their huge shadows are visible against the cosmic microwave background. SLABs could thus appear as negative sources in microwave data. In fact, the shadow of a SLAB with a fixed mass becomes easier to detect with increasing redshifts past $1.6$. The limits are powerful enough to rule out SLABs of mass $\\gtrsim 10^{17}\\ M_{\\odot}$ within the last scattering surface, and imply $Ω_{BH} \\lesssim 10^{-5}$ for masses $10^{15}$--$10^{18}\\ M_{\\odot}$.

In this paper, we present Data Release 1 of the VAST Extragalactic Survey, which targets slowly evolving synchrotron transients in the southern sky. The observations were carried out between June 2023 and May 2025, comprising 2945 images of 276 fields spanning $\\sim 12300\\ \\mathrm{deg}^2$, observed at 888 MHz with a typical rms sensitivity of 0.24 mJy $\\rm{beam}^{-1}$ and 12-20 arcsec resolution. Each field was revisited approximately every two months, yielding 10 or 11 observations per field. The VAST pipeline extracts the light curves for all the observed sources, and additional filters are implemented to improve the reliability of the resulting light curve database. The light curve database contains 0.5 million sources and 6.4 million individual measurements, publicly available through the CSIRO data access portal. An untargeted variability search yields 117 astrophysical variables, including 27 pulsars, 40 radio stars (10 newly detected at radio wavelengths), 44 active galactic nuclei, two optically identified supernovae, one supernova candidate, one brown dwarf, and two sources without multi-wavelength counterparts that are yet to be identified. This data release provides the first large-scale, high-cadence, uniform view of long-term radio variability in the extragalactic sky and lays the groundwork for future population studies of radio transients with ASKAP."}

While the $Λ$CDM paradigm successfully explains structure formation on large scales, its small-scale predictions remain in tension with observations. FDM offers an alternative framework, where local self-interactions can further influence the formation and evolution of structures. We explore both attractive and repulsive contact interactions in static and expanding backgrounds. Using numerical simulations, we examine their impact on three key scenarios: the properties of the lowest-energy stationary solution, the relaxation of localized initial states, and the gravitational collapse of nonlocalized states. Our results show that contact interactions modify the density profile of the stationary solution and affect the onset of characteristic stages of gravitational collapse, particularly the shell-crossing event. In the (1+1) model, we confirm that relaxation does not converge to the lowest-energy stationary solution, even when local self-interactions are included. Taken together, local self-interactions play a relevant role in shaping the nonlinear dynamics of FDM and motivate further studies in higher-dimensional and cosmologically realistic settings."}

In force-free magnetospheres, charges are constrained to move along magnetic field lines and experience zero Lorentz force, due to the everywhere perpendicular orientation of electric and magnetic fields. However, a general angle-preserving conformal mapping of force-free fields does not necessarily produce another physically admissible force-free configuration when sources are present. In this work, we demonstrate that such invariance can nevertheless arise for certain choices of the free functions. Specifically, the governing stream equation is shown to be invariant under Möbius transformations. This symmetry reveals a structural linkage between known solutions and, notably, maps the region inside a magnetospheric horizon (the lightsurface) of one solution to the exterior of its dual counterpart, and vice versa."}

In this framework, the energy exchange between dark energy and dark matter induces a redshift dependence of $H_0$. We evaluate the model against a comprehensive suite of observations, including baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from DESI DR2 and SDSS, cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon sample, and Planck CMB distance priors. Analysis of late-Universe data yields $α= 0.0107^{+0.0032}_{-0.011}$, with the best-fit value on the order of $10^{-2}$, revealing a decreasing trend of $H_0$ with redshift. This supports a power-law evolution beyond $Λ$CDM. Incorporating CMB data further tightens the constraint to the order of $10^{-5}$, which we attribute to the suppression of dark-sector interactions at high redshifts, a consequence of the strong baryon--photon coupling. These results indicate that the IDE framework provides a theoretically consistent and observationally viable mechanism for describing the redshift evolution of $H_0$, offering a promising avenue toward alleviating the Hubble tension."}

Astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic data from the Gaia Data Release 3 catalog were used to ensure a precise characterization of cluster members and their physical properties. Membership determination was performed using the UPMASK algorithm applied to a five-dimensional parameter space, yielding 116, 179, 238, and 387 likely members for each cluster, respectively. Structural parameters were derived by fitting King profiles to the radial density distributions of high-probability members. Astrophysical parameters were estimated through Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo isochrone fitting based on PARSEC evolutionary models, complemented by spectral energy distribution analysis using ARIADNE. The resulting extinctions, distances, metallicities, and ages indicate that these are moderately reddened, intermediate-age clusters located between 1 and 3.5 kpc from the Sun. Mean radial velocities combined with Galactic orbital integrations computed with galpy show that all four clusters follow nearly circular, low-eccentricity orbits typical of thin-disc populations. All four OCs have dynamical relaxation times of 22-98 Myr. However, their ages exceed these times by several factors, particularly in Czernik 24, indicating that they are dynamically evolved systems, even though the calculated T_E values represent lower limits.

We thus calculate the sensitivity of voids to the nature of dark matter (DM), using ultra-light axions as a concrete model and the ongoing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and \\textit{Euclid} galaxy surveys as observational settings. We simulate axion effects on voids using mass-peak patch simulations and find that: (i) axions suppress the formation of lower-mass halos leading to the merging of smaller (radius $< 25\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}/h$) voids into fewer larger (radius $> 25\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}/h$) voids; and (ii) voids in the presence of axions are emptier of halos, thereby suppressing the void-halo correlation function. These effects strengthen as axion particle mass $m_\\mathrm{a}$ decreases. We forecast improvements in axion constraints from the void size function (VSF; the void number density as function of their radius). A \\textit{Euclid}-like survey (effective volume of $73\\,\\mathrm{Gpc}^3$ with a prior on the other $Λ$CDM cosmological parameters from the Simons Observatory cosmic microwave background experiment) can limit the axion energy density (for $m_\\mathrm{a} = 10^{-25}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$) to $< 4.6\\%$ of the DM (at $95\\%$ credibility), about two times stronger than current limits.

Submitted to A&A", "summary": "We revisit black hole mass estimates for high-redshift broad-line AGNs discovered with JWST by jointly analysing their broad emission lines and their systematic non-detections in deep Chandra imaging. Building upon the self-shadowed, super-Eddington accretion flow framework and the coronal over-cooling prescription of Madau & Haardt (2024), we couple funnel-dependent Comptonization physics with slim-disc spectra from Kubota & Done (2019) and explore the resulting parameter space through a full MCMC inference. Using the sample analysed by Lupi et al. (2024) and Maiolino et al. (2025), we show that X-ray weakness - manifested as extreme bolometric corrections, suppressed 2-10 keV luminosities, and non-detections in the 0.5-5 keV Chandra band - naturally arises when the corona is confined and radiatively over-cooled inside a narrow super-Eddington funnel. The combined broad line+X-ray analysis yields strongly bimodal posteriors: either very massive, very low-Eddington black holes (physically disfavoured), or a population of low-mass ($\\sim 10^{6}-10^{7} ~M_{\\odot}$) black holes accreting at $f_{\\rm Edd} \\gg 1$. The latter solution is strongly preferred for nearly all objects and returns masses consistent with, or lower than, local $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{\\rm star}$ relations, mitigating the extreme mass ratios implied by single-epoch virial estimators. The predicted intrinsic spectra are redder and exhibit reduced hard-X-ray output but higher bolometric luminosities, implying bolometric corrections larger than those typical of the local AGN population, yet consistent with low-redshift highly accreting counterparts. These results support a picture in which many JWST broad-line AGNs are powered by rapidly growing, super-Eddington black holes whose suppressed coronal emission and self-shadowed BLR geometry combine to mimic overmassive black holes at $z \\gtrsim 6$."}

We find that, while the 2-point statistics of velocities are reliably inferred on scales larger than $\\sim10\\,\\hMpc$, significant systematic deviations arise on smaller scales. These deviations originate from spatially correlated residuals in the TF and FP relations, driven by correlations between galaxy structural properties, star-formation history, and the local environment. As a result, TF- and FP-inferred velocity fields exhibit spurious correlations with the galaxy density field that cannot be explained by random scatter alone. We show that extending the TF and FP relations to include additional galaxy properties -- such as star formation rate, gas mass, and stellar mass -- mitigate these environmental correlations, particularly for late-type galaxies. Our results demonstrate that galaxy formation physics induces significant systematics in peculiar velocity measurements on non-linear scales, and that neglecting these effects may bias cosmological analyses."}

We provide a public catalog of Sérsic index, effective semi-major axis, axis ratio, integrated magnitude, and position angle for these galaxies in each of the filters. Uncertainties in the measured parameters are estimated from simulated galaxies that have similar noise and background properties as the observed galaxies. We compare our measurements with those in the CANDELS/EGS field measured with HST/WFC3 and find that the sizes agree to within 0.09 dex and the Sérsic indices agree to within 0.13 dex. We further present the evolution in the size-mass relation, and find that the evolution to $z\\sim9$ is consistent with previous results derived at lower redshift. Finally, we look at the color gradients of galaxies at $1<z<5$ and find that for late-type galaxies ($n<2.5$), there is a strong dependence on mass, but no apparent evolution with redshift, indicating that the stellar populations and dust attenuation in more massive galaxies vary substantially with radius and contribute to significant morphological $k-$corrections. For early type galaxies ($n>2.5$), the color gradients are nearly flat with no dependence on mass, indicating that the stellar populations are more uniform throughout.

However, low-frequency studies often lack the resolution needed to locate particle acceleration sites or separate diffuse emission from radio galaxies. In this paper, we unveil the properties of the radio relic in the distant cluster PSZ2G091.83+26.11 (z=0.822) by resolving the acceleration site and inspecting the downstream region. Using the European LOFAR (ILT) at 145 MHz, we study a radio relic at (sub-)arcsecond resolution for the first time below 1 GHz, complemented by arcsecond-resolution VLA data at higher frequencies. We confirm the diffuse emission is not a radio galaxy. A spectral index gradient toward the cluster center matches previous 5'' maps. High-resolution 0.4'' and 1.9'' images reveal emission ahead of the shock, connecting the relic to a radio galaxy. 1.9'' profiles across the downstream at 145 MHz and 3.0 GHz follow a log-normal magnetic field distribution. The 145 MHz shock surface shows a sharp discontinuity at the same location of a change in electron density, Rotation Measure, and fractional polarization, likely tied to magnetic field changes. Finally, we find hints of redshift evolution of the radio power versus cluster mass correlation. The impressive angular resolution achievable by the LOFAR long baselines is opening an unprecedented view of the low energetic plasma in galaxy clusters. This is extremely significant in the case of high-redshift clusters, where radio emission at low frequencies is less affected by energy losses but its detection is strongly limited by poor resolution."}

These solutions can be parametrized by the period $L$, the mass $M$, and the absolute value of the angular momentum $|J| >0$.

Using filament and superbubble structure analysis codes, we investigate the roles of galactic shear, supernovae and superbubbles, and magnetic fields on the stability and fragmentation of filaments. We find that local shear has little effect on filament stability and the largest structures at outer radii of the disk may be more likely to be dissipated by shear than supernovae. Filaments are largely parallel to the magnetic field, which plays a significant role in filament stability. By measuring the ratio of surface pressure on a filament to that on its central spine, $χ_f=P_{surf}/P_{central}$, we find that filaments with $χ_f \\le 1$ are dominated by their own self gravity and have a strong tendency to be gravitationally supercritical, whereas those with $χ_f > 1$ are either transitory or in the act of being formed. Finally, we investigate the role of ISM pressure on filament dynamics and stability as a function of galactic radius, finding considerable changes in filament stability and the accompanying star formation rates in the inner versus outer regions of the disk."}

However, it remains unclear on which spatial scales primordial signatures can survive the nonlinear processes accompanying structure formation. The aim of this study is to investigate the evolution of PMFs during gravitational collapse and to determine the spatial scales on which primordial signatures can persist. We perform a suite of high-resolution direct numerical simulations of self-gravitating, magnetized halos. By varying the viscosity, we probe different Reynolds-number regimes and follow the coupled evolution of gravitational collapse and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. At sufficiently high Reynolds numbers, turbulence generated during collapse triggers the onset of a small-scale dynamo, which amplifies magnetic energy below the Jeans scale and modifies the magnetic energy spectrum significantly. Whether dynamo amplification dominates the magnetic field evolution is determined by the competition between the dynamo growth time and the free-fall time. Our results highlight the importance of resolving the Jeans scale and the associated turbulent inertial range in cosmological MHD simulations to accurately capture the interplay between gravitational compression and dynamo amplification and to assess which structures retain memory of primordial fields."}

We show that the often employed Schwarzschild-like form of the flat metric is not appropriate for the WKB calculation with an arbitrary $a(t)$, and instead derive a generalized Unruh temperature for the generalized Rindler metric where $a_0\\to a(t)$. We derive a generalization of the Rindler coordinates appropriate for arbitrary $a(t)$, and stress the importance of the role of the integrated acceleration $χ(t) = \\int^t dt'\\,a(t')$, which can also act as a temporal coordinate. We explore several non-trivial examples of $a(t)$ and their generalized Unruh temperatures. We additionally develop an approximation to the Unruh temperature for small deviations away from constant acceleration by the standard approach of considering the negative frequency content of a purely positive frequency plane wave of an inertial observer, as measured by the co-moving arbitrarily accelerated observer. Lastly, we develop and explicit coordinate transformation between the arbitrarily accelerated observer and conformal coordinates, where the plane wave structure of the solutions of the wave equation is readily transparent, and analogous to the form for the inertial observer."}

We introduce a galactic chemical evolution model DLEIY that uses an observed star formation history and metallicity distribution to reduce these confounding factors. Using a joint statistical model of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies Sculptor and Fornax, simultaneous constraints on population-averaged yields and galactic outflows are achieved with DLEIY, without fixing the absolute scale of nucleosynthetic yields. The Fe yield from core collapse supernovae is consistent with existing theoretical yield models, while the measured Mg yield is a factor of 2-4 higher, corroborating previous suggestions that yield models may under-predict [Mg/Fe]. We also find that the rate of Type Ia supernovae is enhanced by about a factor of 5 relative to field galaxies, and the delay-time distribution goes as $\\sim t^{-2}$, a much steeper relationship than that measured from supernova surveys ($\\sim t^{-1.1}$).

Treating the quasi-local horizon energies as the relevant thermodynamic variables, we formulate a horizon-by-horizon first law and Smarr relation. Using a reduced phase-space quantization, we obtain a discrete MSH mass spectrum for both horizons, which reproduces the minimal entropy spacing. Quantum transitions between adjacent levels yield Planck-scale corrections to the Hawking temperatures and a universal logarithmic contribution to the entropy, consistent with independent approaches to quantum gravity. We encode these corrections into a quantum-deformed RN geometry via a simple multiplicative factor that preserves the classical horizon positions while reproducing the corrected surface gravities. The associated effective stress tensor behaves as a conserved vacuum-polarization source with characteristic $r^{-4}$ falloff and a small trace, providing a compact representation of semiclassical backreaction. The deformation slightly lowers both horizon temperatures, weakens the inner-horizon instability, and induces tiny shifts in photon-sphere and shadow observables for macroscopic BHs."}

We welcome your thoughts and feedback!", "summary": "The evolutionary classification of molecular clumps, crucial for understanding star formation, is commonly based on human-assigned categories derived from infrared (IR) emission and well-established morphological criteria. However, due to ambiguous signatures, distance uncertainties or heavily obscured IR emission, a significant fraction of sources often remains unclassified. This work demonstrates the capability of machine learning (ML) as a complementary, data-driven approach to automate the identification and classification of these clumps using data from the MALT90 survey, complemented by Spitzer IR photometry. We applied unsupervised clustering with HDBSCAN on molecular line intensities, revealing distinct groupings that correspond to evolutionary stages. Using only five molecular lines (HCO$^+$, HNC, N$_2$H$^+$, HCN, C$_2$H), we identified stable clusters of protostars and regions without active star formation, driven primarily by C$_2$H and N$_2$H$^+$ emission. Incorporating H$^{13}$CO$^+$ gave rise to a distinct UV-dominant cluster, tracing more evolved regions. Infrared properties appeared as non-significant features implying that envelopes of clumps with different masses are similar in their global infrared characteristics. We then employed supervised learning to classify clumps with previously uncertain categories and provided classifications for 522 objects, predominantly as regions without active star formation. Our results show that ML techniques can effectively uncover intrinsic evolutionary structures in complex astrochemical data and assign categories to uncertain sources, providing a powerful, data-driven complement to traditional methods."}

Using inclination-dependent SEDs as input to Cloudy, we show that the extreme broad Halpha equivalent widths (EWs) of JWST LRDs are reproduced with global BLR covering factors of only 15%, consistent with standard Type 1 AGNs. Large Balmer EWs arise because self-shadowing suppresses the high-inclination optical continuum while the BLR is illuminated by an EUV-rich SED. Weak high-ionization lines follow from orientation-dependent suppression of the XUV/soft X-ray continuum toward equatorial directions, without requiring a fully enclosing gaseous \"cocoon\". With a gray attenuation law of AV = 2.8 along LRD-selected sightlines, the fiducial model matches the V-shaped UV-optical continua and large Balmer decrements; strong Balmer breaks occur only for the most obscured views. A compact equatorial dust component tied to the BLR and normalized by energy conservation intercepts and reradiates only a small fraction of Lbol, producing a modest hot-dust bump and far-IR/sub-mm emission consistent with current limits and implying small dust masses. The model unifies LRD and LBD observables via orientation, predicting correlated trends in Halpha EW, Balmer decrement, Balmer break, high-ionization line strengths, and IR emission."}

Kinematic measurements indicate that molecular and ionized gas phases are dynamically and spatially linked, supporting the framework of a multiphase medium arising from the top-down condensation rain in the hot plasma and related chaotic cold accretion. Crucially, spatial variations in the total-to-selective extinction ratio Rv show that regions where dust, CO, and H-alpha emission coincide exhibit notably smaller Rv values, implying steeper extinction curves and the predominance of smaller or less evolved dust grains within these mixed-phase environments.

Analysis of late-Universe data yields $α= 0.0107^{+0.0032}_{-0.011}$, with the best-fit value on the order of $10^{-2}$, revealing a decreasing trend of $H_0$ with redshift. This supports a power-law evolution beyond $Λ$CDM. Incorporating CMB data further tightens the constraint to the order of $10^{-5}$, which we attribute to the suppression of dark-sector interactions at high redshifts, a consequence of the strong baryon--photon coupling.

Trained and evaluated on approximately 300,000 single-band images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI-LS), the model achieves a normalized median absolute deviation $σ_{\\rm NMAD} = 0.034$ and an outlier fraction $f_{\\rm out} = 2.6\\%$ in the $r$-band for redshifts up to $z \\lesssim 1$. Evaluations using probability integral transform (PIT) and continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) confirm that the predicted probability density functions are well calibrated and closely match the true distribution. These results demonstrate that competitive redshift estimates can be obtained using morphological features alone, and that incorporating color information further enhances the accuracy and robustness of the estimation. Therefore, ViT-MDNz provides a practical approach for redshift estimation of galaxy samples with limited photometric band coverage, contributing to improved completeness and usability of redshift catalogs for future large-scale surveys such as DESI and LSST."}

The Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat, with 1.5arcsec resolution, has enabled the characterization of recently formed (up to 300 Myr) SFCs on tens of parsec scales in nearby galaxies. The spatial distribution of SFCs with different ages can provide insights into the hierarchy of star formation. This study presents a semi-novel approach to characterize SFCs in two nearby spiral galaxies, NGC 5457 and NGC 1313, by combining UVIT FUV data with g-band data from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS). We tested and optimized our method on NGC 5457 and showed that after proper background subtraction, the FUV-g color of SFCs can serve as an equally reliable age indicator as the widely-used FUV-NUV color. Next, we parametrized the star formation hierarchy in NGC 5457 using the two-point correlation function (TPCF) and found good agreement between the hierarchy parameters derived using FUV-NUV and FUV-g based ages. Using our FUV-g based SFC ages, we also constrained the global hierarchy parameter of NGC 1313 for the first time. The development of our FUV-g based method is motivated by the fact that the NUV channel of the UVIT is not operational, and there is a wealth of archival UVIT FUV-only observations of nearby galaxies. This work demonstrates the potential of our method in constraining the SFC ages and investigating hierarchical star formation in nearby galaxies using FUV and optical observations."}

We present a time-resolved, per galaxy analysis of SMBH mass assembly that explicitly tracks bar formation, merger events, and the environment along the main progenitor branches using the high resolution IllustrisTNG50 cosmological simulation. We analyze barred and unbarred disc galaxies in isolated and non-isolated environments using physically motivated boundary definitions. We found that SMBH fueling pathways are regulated by the environment through the timing of bar formation relative to mergers. In isolated barred galaxies, stellar bars form early in dynamically cold discs and establish sustained, coherent accretion phases that regulate late-time SMBH growth. In contrast, in non-isolated galaxies, SMBH growth is dominated by early merger-driven accretion episodes, whereas bars form later and contribute weakly to the primary growth phase. Unbarred control samples show that mergers can trigger rapid SMBH growth without bars, but such growth remains episodic, whereas isolated discs without bars lack sustained accretion. These results demonstrate an environmental bifurcation in SMBH fueling: mergers act as efficient triggers of early growth in dynamically active systems, while bars regulate prolonged accretion only when they form in quiescent discs. This study provides a unified time-domain framework linking galaxy environment, disc dynamics, and SMBH growth by resolving the temporal ordering of bars, mergers, and accretion."}

We present a multi-wavelength work of J1611+4026, a unique triple system characterised by a massive early-type host galaxy, Component C and two gas-rich companions, Components A and B, which are currently undergoing a major merger in its near environment. Utilising deep optical imaging from DESI-LS and spectroscopic data from DESI and P200, we employ 2D morphological decomposition using \\textsc{GALIGHT} alongside joint spectrophotometric synthesis modelling with \\textsc{BAGPIPES} and \\textsc{CIGALE} to deconstruct the structural properties and star formation histories of the member galaxies. Crucially, we identify an asymmetric tidal tail extending $\\sim$15.15 kpc from Component A, confirming the ongoing interaction between the companions. Although Component C appears quiescent in both morphology and spectroscopy, we reveal a subtle robust signal of ``minor rejuvenation'', characterised by significant internal dust extinction of $E(B-V) \\sim 0.53$ and a UV excess. The reconstructed star formation history indicates a recent ($\\sim$100 Myr) starburst that contributes a negligible fraction to the total stellar mass ($f_{\\rm burst} < 0.1$ per cent). We propose that this activity is fueled by the accretion of metal-enriched gas stripped from the interacting companions. These results strongly suggest group pre-processing, where interactions between satellite galaxies drive low-level star formation in the massive host through gas transfer, providing a quantitative benchmark for interaction-driven evolution in dense environments."}

We apply the HI intensity mapping technique to interferometric data from the MeerKAT International GHz-Tiered Extragalactic Explorations (MIGHTEE) Survey, analysing 17.5 hours of a single pointing in the COSMOS field, using a 60 MHz sub-band in the frequency range 1332 - 1392 MHz ($0.02 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 0.07$). Using a delay-spectrum-based estimator, we measure the HI power spectrum on sub-megaparsec scales and compare it directly to the power spectrum inferred from a catalogue of individually detected HI galaxies in the same field. After mitigating low-level broadband contamination through conservative outlier flagging in the three-dimensional power spectrum, cross-correlation of time-split visibilities yields a statistically significant detection on scales $3 \\lesssim k \\lesssim 20 \\, \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ with a total signal-to-noise ratio of $\\sim 13$.

End-to-end validation is performed by propagating detected galaxies through the power spectrum estimator via both direct intensity-field construction and simulated visibilities, demonstrating agreement up to $k \\sim 20 \\ \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, beyond which measurements become noise-dominated. A statistically significant correlation is also observed between the data and the simulated visibilities from the detected HI galaxies, which should be free of systematics. These results provide a self-consistent validation of interferometric HI intensity mapping at low redshift and demonstrate agreement with galaxy-based measurements within the same cosmological volume."}

This master sample allows for performance tests of photometric selections and unveils what types of sources, either AGN or young star formation, were producing excessive ionizing radiation in the early Universe. We identify AGN through broad H alpha emission-lines and report 6 new broad-line AGN at 3.5<z<7 identified by the deep (~8 hr) G395M THRILS survey. We investigate the photometrically selected EELGs in a color-color plot designed for ``Little Red Dot'' selection and demonstrate that it effectively removes AGN with non-extreme lines from the sample. EELGs with and without broad lines show similar optical line ratios. We compare emission-line morphology to EWs and continuum morphologies and find that [OIII] morphology is more compact at higher EW. ~10% of photometrically selected EELGs have broad Balmer lines, jumping to 35% in deep spectroscopy which indicates a significant fraction of photometrically selected EELGs may host AGN. However, many AGN selected as EELGs have incorrectly high photometric EWs. For sources with extreme emission-line EWs that pass our photometric criteria and host an AGN, we find that the narrow H alpha component dominates over the broad, especially in the highest-EW sources. This implies that even when an AGN is present, it does not dominate the extreme emission."}

However, it remains unclear on which spatial scales primordial signatures can survive the nonlinear processes accompanying structure formation. The aim of this study is to investigate the evolution of PMFs during gravitational collapse and to determine the spatial scales on which primordial signatures can persist. We perform a suite of high-resolution direct numerical simulations of self-gravitating, magnetized halos. By varying the viscosity, we probe different Reynolds-number regimes and follow the coupled evolution of gravitational collapse and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. At sufficiently high Reynolds numbers, turbulence generated during collapse triggers the onset of a small-scale dynamo, which amplifies magnetic energy below the Jeans scale and modifies the magnetic energy spectrum significantly. Whether dynamo amplification dominates the magnetic field evolution is determined by the competition between the dynamo growth time and the free-fall time. Our results highlight the importance of resolving the Jeans scale and the associated turbulent inertial range in cosmological MHD simulations to accurately capture the interplay between gravitational compression and dynamo amplification and to assess which structures retain memory of primordial fields."}
