We combine the EFTofLSS full-shape analysis of the power spectrum and bispectrum of BOSS data with the tomographic angular power spectra $C_\\ell^{gg}$, $C_\\ell^{κg}$, $C_\\ell^{Tg}$ and $C_\\ell^{Tκ}$, where $g$, $κ$ and $T$ stand for the DESI luminous red galaxy map, Planck PR4 lensing map and Planck PR4 temperature map, respectively. To analyze these angular power spectra, we go beyond the Limber approximation, allowing us to include large-scales data in $C_\\ell^{gg}$. The combination of all these probes with Planck PR4, DESI DR2 BAO and DES Y5 improves the constraint on the 2D posterior distribution of $\\{w_0, \\, w_a\\}$ by $\\sim 50 \\%$ and increases the preference for evolving dark energy over $Λ$ from $3.8 σ$ to $4.6 σ$. When we remove BAO and supernovae data, we obtain a hint for evolving dark energy at $2.3 σ$. Regarding the EFTofDE parameters, we improve the constraints on $α_B$ and $α_M$ by $\\sim 40 \\%$ and $50 \\%$ respectively, finding results compatible with general relativity at $\\sim 2 σ$. We show that these constraints do not depend on the choice of the BAO and supernovae likelihoods."}

Cornish"], "title": "Non-stationary noise in gravitational wave analyses: The wavelet domain noise covariance matrix", "comment": "7 pages, no figures", "summary": "Gravitational wave detectors produce time series of the gravitational wave strain co-added with instrument noise. For evenly sampled data, such as from laser interferometers, it has been traditional to Fourier transform the data and perform analyses in the frequency domain. The motivation being that the Fourier domain noise covariance matrix will be diagonal if the noise properties are constant in time, which greatly simplifies and accelerates the analysis. However, if the noise is non-stationary this advantage is lost. It has been proposed that the time-frequency or wavelet domain is better suited for studying non-stationary noise, at least when the time variation is suitably slow, since then the wavelet domain noise covariance matrix is, to a good approximation, diagonal. Here we investigate the conditions under which the diagonal approximation is appropriate for the case of the Wilson-Daubechies-Meyer (WDM) wavelet packet basis, which is seeing increased use in gravitational wave data analysis. We show that so long as the noise varies slowly across a wavelet pixel, in both time {\\em and} frequency, the WDM noise correlation matrix is well approximated as diagonal. The off-diagonal terms are proportional to the time and frequency derivatives of the dynamic spectral model. The same general picture should apply to other discrete wavelet transforms with wavelet filters that are suitably compact in time and frequency. Strategies for handling data with rapidly varying noise that violate these assumptions are discussed."}
