Using the scale factor ansatz $α(t)=\\left(\\fracαη+t^2\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2 η}}$, we reconstruct the scalar field potential $V(t)$, and observe a smooth potential well centered at the bounce point. The resulting energy density, pressure, and equation-of-state parameter show NEC violation necessary for successful bounce, while viscosity controls post-bounce dynamics with a positive and smooth squared speed of sound. In contrast, for the non-viscous model, sharp divergences occur just at the bounce and continues to be negative in the expanding phase, which in turn emphasises the stabilising role of dissipative effects. The energy condition analysis indicates a temporary NEC and SEC violation in the viscous scenario, whereas its persistent violation within the non-viscous model suggests a continuous accelerated expansion. Observational viability is found through Bayesian MCMC fitting in regards to the Pantheon+ supernova data, with best-fit parameters providing a reduced chi-squared of $χ_{red}^2 =0.995$ while the inflation observables derived from the reconstructed potential place our model predictions inside $68\\%$ CL Planck 2018 confidence contours. Our findings suggest that bounce cosmologies could offer a physically reasonable and observationally acceptable alternative or pre-inflationary scenario, while highlighting the role that viscosity could play for a stable and smooth cosmological evolution."}

How can we reasonably assess a theory that describes such a mostly unobservable universe? We propose a Bayesian method based on theory-generated probability distributions for our observations. We focus on basic principles, leaving aside concerns about practicality. (We also leave aside the measure problem, to discuss other issues.) We argue that cosmological theories can be tested by standard Bayesian updating, but we need to use theoretical predictions for \"first-person\" probabilities -- i.e., probabilities for our observations, accounting for all relevant selection effects. These selection effects can depend on the observer, and on time, so in principle first-person probabilities are defined for each observer-instant -- an observer at an instant of time. First-person probabilities should take into account everything the observer believes about herself and her surroundings -- i.e., her \"subjective state\". We advocate a \"Principle of Self-Locating Indifference\" (PSLI), asserting that any real observer should make predictions as if she were chosen randomly from the theoretically predicted observer-instants that share her subjective state. We believe the PSLI is intuitively very reasonable, but also argue that it maximizes the expected fraction of observers who will make correct predictions. Cosmological theories will in general predict a set of possible universes, each with a probability. To calculate first-person probabilities, we argue that each possible universe should be weighted by the number of observer-instants in the specified subjective state that it contains. We also discuss Boltzmann brains, the humans/Jovians parable of Hartle and Srednicki, and the use of \"old evidence\"."}

Such systems can be used to provide simultaneous constraints on the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the dark-energy equation of state, independent of and complementary to other probes. However, just as for single-plane gravitational lenses, the precision of these constraints is limited by the so-called mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) -- a fundamental limit to the knowledge of the mass profiles of lens galaxies and the line of sight that can be obtained from imaging constraints alone. In this work, we show explicitly how contributions from the line of sight appear in double-plane systems. Because these contributions modify angular diameter distances, we argue that cosmological priors should not be used to simply fix the ``cosmological scaling factor'', a ratio of angular diameter distances which is key to the modelling of double-plane lenses. Motivated by this fact, we generalise the double-plane MSD to account for this uncertainty in the scaling factor. While this complicates the time-delay function, we show that, using the ``unfolding relation'', a geometric relation between distances which holds even in the presence of line-of-sight corrections, the uncertainty in the Hubble constant reduces to the familiar mass-sheet transformation of the first lens plane, and a line-of-sight contribution between the observer and the second lens plane. Our main message is therefore a prescription for reducing the degrees of freedom within double-plane models, while still safely accounting for the MSD in measurements of $H_0$."}

Strong degeneracies, both among the parameters controlling the phase transition and between these and the parameters of the beyond-Standard-Model scenario underlying the phase transition, complicate the reconstruction of the model from a potential signal.

It has recently been shown that WLM is losing its gas due to ram pressure forces exerted by the surrounding intergalactic medium (IGM). In this work, we explore how ram pressure may also affect the WLM gas kinematics, and we show that its dynamics is especially perturbed at its outskirts, explaining the asymmetric rotation between the approaching and receding sides. Moreover, we have been able to decompose WLM in two main components, a compact one with a solid-body rotation that resembles a bar-like structure, and a more extended one with a characteristic double-horn profile suggesting an edge-on disk. The former is relatively unaffected by ram pressure while the latter has its dynamics considerably affected by ram pressure. This study shows that mass estimates of a dwarf galaxy like WLM should account for a full modeling of its dynamical components, especially accounting for its asymmetric rotation curve."}

The model successfully resolves the initial singularity problem by demonstrating a nonsingular bounce, where the universe transitions from a contracting phase $ \\dot{a}(t)<0 $ to an expanding phase ($ \\dot{a}(t)>0 $) at the bouncing point $t \\approx 0.$ Key features include the violation of the null energy condition (NEC) near the bounce and the crossing of the phantom divide line ($ω=-1$) by the equation of state (EoS) parameter, indicating quintom-like behavior. The model exhibits accelerated expansion post-bounce, suggesting an inflationary phase. Stability analysis via the adiabatic index reveals instability near the bouncing point, while energy conditions highlight the dominance of dark energy. Additionally, the study explores scalar fields, showing that quintessence-like kinetic energy becomes negative and phantom-like kinetic energy peaks positively near the bounce, aligning with dark energy dynamics. The Hubble parameter, deceleration parameter, and Hubble radius further validate the bouncing scenario, with the latter displaying symmetric behaviour around the bounce. These results underscore the viability of Weyl-type $f(Q)$ gravity as a framework for nonsingular bouncing cosmologies, offering insights into early universe dynamics and dark energy behaviour."}

To elucidate these trends, we employ an analytical framework that explicitly connects these kiloparsec-scale properties to the timescales governing the rapid, continuous ISM gas cycle on the scales of individual star-forming regions, including the formation, dispersal, and local depletion of star-forming gas. Using a suite of idealized disk galaxy simulations spanning a range of environments from dwarf and Milky Way-mass systems to a gas-rich starburst analog, we measure the timescales of the gas cycle and relate them to the dynamical and turbulent properties of the interstellar medium (ISM). We find that star-forming regions form on a timescale close to the vertical turbulent crossing time of the galactic disk, $\\sim$3-30 Myr, which decreases at higher $Σ_{\\rm gas}$ due to the increase in turbulent velocities in the ISM and the decrease in the disk thickness. In contrast, the local star formation and dispersal of such gas are set by the local conditions. Specifically, the local depletion time, $\\sim$200-2000 Myr, is decreasing at higher $Σ_{\\rm gas}$, as star-forming gas becomes denser and more efficient in forming stars. The lifetime of such gas is very short, $\\sim$0.4-1 Myr, and only weakly increases with $Σ_{\\rm gas}$. Together, our results demonstrate how the star formation properties of galaxies on kiloparsec scales emerge directly from the interplay between the galaxy-scale dynamics, ISM turbulence, and the state of star-forming gas."}

Astrophysical foregrounds, as the main source of contamination to the cosmological 21 cm signal, persist in a wedge-like region of Fourier space due to the inherent chromaticity in radio interferometric observations. The foreground avoidance strategy focuses on utilizing data from relatively clean regions with minimal foreground leakage, at the cost of losing large-scale information. Non-linear structure formation, however, couples Fourier modes across scales, leaving imprints of the missing large-scale modes in the remaining data. In this work, we employ a deep learning approach to test whether large-scale features of the 21 cm brightness temperature fields, particularly the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), can be recovered at the field level using only short-wavelength modes that are beyond the linear scales. To explicitly assess the dependence on the training cosmology, we train the network exclusively on de-wiggled simulations, providing a controlled test of whether the reconstruction arises from physical non-linear mode coupling rather than implicit encoding of BAO features. In the ideal noise-free case, the amplitude and phase of the lost modes can be restored with high fidelity. With instrumental noise included, the reconstructed amplitude becomes biased, while the phase information remains robust. The trained network also exhibits reasonable robustness to variations in the underlying cosmological model. Together, these results suggest that mode restoration offers a complementary approach for extracting cosmological information from future 21 cm intensity mapping analyses."}

We present proper motion measurements for 23 SiO-maser emitting stars within 45'' of SgrA*, including four previously reported to have velocities exceeding their local escape velocities (i.e., they are \"locally unbound\" from the GC). Derived from 14 epochs of HST WFC3-IR observations (2010 - 2023), our measurements have a median precision of 0.038 mas/yr - up to ~100x more precise then previous constraints for some sources. By combining these proper motions with published radial velocities, we derive updated 3D velocities for the masers and find that only one is locally unbound (IRS 9; v3d = 370 +/- 1.2 km/s). Orbit integrations place the first constraints on the orbit of IRS 9, which is bound to the GC at larger radii with r_peri >= 0.100 +/- 0.005 pc and r_apo >= 5.25 +/- 0.18 pc. IRS 9's high velocity relative to stars at similar radii in the Nuclear Star Cluster makes it a candidate to have experienced a strong dynamical interaction in order to place it on its orbit. We explore the Hills mechanism as a possible origin, but binary evaporation and ejection velocity limits indicate that IRS 9 is unlikely to have experienced such an event in the past 0.4 Myr (the timescale constrained by the orbit integrations). Alternative mechanisms that could produce IRS 9 include binary supernova disruption, two-body interactions, and stellar collisions. Identifying additional stars like IRS 9 will be essential for understanding these various dynamical processes."}

By fitting the King model to the radial density profiles, we determined the structural parameters of the clusters, including core and limiting radii, which were found to range from 3.07 to 16.21 arcmin and from 9.97 to 25.97 arcmin, respectively. Fundamental astrophysical parameters were derived by fitting PARSEC isochrones to the colour-magnitude diagrams. The results show that the clusters have logarithmic ages between 7.95 and 9.34, metallicities in the range 0.007 to 0.015, and heliocentric distances between 1640 and 5203 pc. The total stellar masses of the clusters were estimated to lie between 257 and 1916 solar masses. For most of the clusters, the mass function slopes are consistent with the Salpeter initial mass function. Our dynamical analysis indicates that all clusters, except Ruprecht 15, are dynamically relaxed.

This result is in agreement with Donato et al. (2009)'s results, claiming the existence of a quasi-universal surface density in all masses in galaxies. The Milgrom paper also predicts that objects with mean inner acceleration smaller than the values discussed do %es not show the quasi-universal behavior of the surface density discussed. In the present paper, we extend the result of Milgrom's paper, based on a point mass model, considering spiral galaxies, modelled with a double exponential disk. Similar to Milgrom's results, we find the existence of a universal surface density for galaxies with large surface density, and a different behavior for galaxies having small surface density."}

Many of these targets extend to the outer regions of the Clouds, which are known to span ~20 deg (LMC) and ~12 deg(SMC) and contain diffuse substructures of unclear origin. BOSS data in the inner regions also complement APOGEE by providing elements inaccessible in the near-infrared and enabling cross-calibration between instruments.

The dynamics are integrated with a particle-mesh gravity solver, thus probing the mildly non-linear regime. The code is applied to the Cosmicflows-4 compilation of peculiar velocities up to z < 0.05 (160 Mpc/h). The constrained ICs a re-simulated with a high precision N-body code.\n  A series of one hundred dark-matter only cosmological constrained simulations with a resolution of 512^3 particles in a 500^3 [Mpc/h]3 box is presented. Special attention is given to twelve prominent nearby galaxy clusters, whose simulated counterparts are matched on criteria of mass and separation.

This fraction is even higher when smaller spatial scales are probed at high S/N ratio: we show that the two most strongly lensed LRDs known to date, A383-LRD and the newly discovered A68-LRD, both have UV-bright companions at separations of only $d\\sim0.3$ kpc, below the resolution limit of most unlensed JWST samples. We explore whether these ubiquitous red/blue configurations may be physically linked to the formation of LRDs, in analogy with the \"synchronized pair\" scenario originally proposed for direct-collapse black hole formation. In this picture, ultraviolet radiation from the companions, which typically have modest stellar masses ($M_\\ast \\sim 10^{8-9}M_\\odot$), suppresses molecular hydrogen cooling in nearby gas, allowing nearly isothermal collapse and the formation of extremely compact objects, such as massive black holes or quasi-stars.

This branch will be populated by stars comprising a quark-matter core and a hadronic-matter envelope, i.e., hybrid stars, which represent ``twin-star'' solutions to equilibria having the same mass but a fully hadronic EOS. While both branches are stable to linear perturbations, it is unclear which of the twin solutions is the ``favoured'' one, that is, which of the two configurations is expected to be found in nature. We assess this point by performing a large campaign of general-relativistic simulations aimed at assessing the response of compact stars on the two branches to perturbations of various strength. In this way, we find that, independently of whether the stars populate the hadronic or the twin branch, their response is characterised by a critical-perturbation strength such that the star will oscillate on the original branch for subcritical perturbations and migrate to the neighbouring branch for supercritical perturbations while conserving rest-mass. Because the critical values are different for stars with the same rest-mass but sitting on either branch, it is possible to define as favoured the part of the branch that has the largest critical perturbation, thus correcting the common wisdom that stellar models on the twin branch are the favoured ones. Interestingly, we show that the binding energies on the two branches can be used to deduce without simulations which of the stellar configurations is more likely to be found in nature."}

The model successfully resolves the initial singularity problem by demonstrating a nonsingular bounce, where the universe transitions from a contracting phase $ \\dot{a}(t)<0 $ to an expanding phase ($ \\dot{a}(t)>0 $) at the bouncing point $t \\approx 0.$ Key features include the violation of the null energy condition (NEC) near the bounce and the crossing of the phantom divide line ($ω=-1$) by the equation of state (EoS) parameter, indicating quintom-like behavior. The model exhibits accelerated expansion post-bounce, suggesting an inflationary phase. Stability analysis via the adiabatic index reveals instability near the bouncing point, while energy conditions highlight the dominance of dark energy. Additionally, the study explores scalar fields, showing that quintessence-like kinetic energy becomes negative and phantom-like kinetic energy peaks positively near the bounce, aligning with dark energy dynamics. The Hubble parameter, deceleration parameter, and Hubble radius further validate the bouncing scenario, with the latter displaying symmetric behaviour around the bounce.

If second order shear terms on external and internal mass sheets can be neglected, we show that the MSD is always retained, and the mass sheets influence can be reabsorbed in the redefinition of angular diameter distances. In particular, internal and external mass sheets can be placed on the same footing. The version of the MSD discussed here does not require any particular relation between the internal mass sheets in the different planes.

When interpreting spectra, it is typical to adopt a single zone model, e.g. at fixed density, pressure, or temperature, to infer H II region properties. However, such an assumption may not fully capture the complexities of a turbulent interstellar medium. To understand how a complex density field driven by supersonic turbulence impacts nebular emission lines, we simulate 3D H II regions surrounding a single O star, both with and without supersonic turbulence. We find that turbulence directly impacts the values of common strong line ratios. For example turbulent H II regions exhibit systematically higher [N II]/H$α$, lower [O III]/H$β$, and lower O32, compared to homogeneous H II regions with the same mean density and ionizing source. These biases can impact inferences of metallicity, ionization parameter, excitation, and ionization source. For our choice of turbulence, direct $T_e$ method metallicity inferences are biased low, by up to 0.1 dex, which is important for metallicity studies, but not enough to explain the abundance discrepancy problem. Finally, we show that large differences between measured electron densities emerge between infrared, optical, and UV density indicators. Our results motivate the need for large grids of turbulent H II regions models that span the range of conditions seen at both high and low redshift to better interpret observed spectra."}

Integrable singularities (IS) have recently gained attention because they avoid both issues and exhibit finite tidal forces, allowing nondestructive radial infall. First, we present a new BH solution sourced by a string fluid (FS) that exhibits an IS. Motivated by the divergence of the conserved energy in the cloud of strings (CS) model, we introduce an energy density profile based on the screening of the CS energy density within an FS framework, yielding a finite conserved energy. On the other hand, it has been proposed \\cite{Ovalle:2024wtv} that an interior region, rather than a pointlike mass, can generate a Schwarzschild BH exterior region. Secondly, motivated by the variety of BH solutions with singularities in the literature, we establish the conditions that an interior region with an IS must satisfy to represent a generic exterior BH solution, with Schwarzschild being only a particular case of the latter. We derive the junction conditions (JC) between the interior and exterior regions, showing that they lead to temperature continuity at the interface, while discontinuities in tangential pressure lead to phase transitions. We propose that the nature of the interior region is described by CS and FS, while the exterior corresponds to Reissner Nordström."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "We present a deep photometric study of the globular cluster NGC 5466 and its tidal stream using Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) imaging with the metallicity-sensitive narrowband filter NB395. We develop an improved member-selection technique based on a k-nearest neighbor algorithm applied to the color-color-magnitude diagram (CCMD), enabling reliable candidate identification down to $i_{2,0} < 23.5$. Photometric metallicities derived from NB395 colors agree with previous measurements, supporting the robustness of our calibration. While modest residual contamination and possible offsets - potentially driven by variations in light-element abundances - may remain beyond 10 arcmin, the metallicity distribution of high-probability inner members matches the known mean metallicity of NGC 5466, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. The spatial distribution of NB395-selected stars clearly delineates the tidal stream. Beyond the tidal radius, the azimuthally averaged radial surface density profile follows a power law with slope $α= -4.53_{-0.14}^{+0.13}$. We also detect a power-law component perpendicular to the stream, suggestive of multiple apogalactic passages. A density gap is identified at a projected distance of $\\sim200$ pc from the cluster center, consistent with eTidal N-body predictions and possibly associated with a recent pericentric passage or Galactic disk interaction. Analysis of the main-sequence mass function reveals a strong negative radial gradient in the slope within the tidal radius, whereas the slope along the outer stream is relatively flat, consistent with preferential tidal stripping of low-mass stars. These results highlight the power of HSC/NB395 photometry for identifying metal-poor populations and deriving photometric metallicities, underscoring its value for future wide-field surveys."}

In this work, we study the precession of the spherical orbit in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson geometry describing a rotating black hole immersed in a uniform electromagnetic field. Although the timelike geodesics is non-separable, we develop a Hamiltonian approach to investigate the spherical orbits. For sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the study shows that the spherical orbits can only exist within a finite radial range for given orbital inclination. Requiring the existence of the spherical orbits, we obtain an upper bound of the magnetic field, i.e., $B<0.33 M^{-1}$ for prograde and $B<0.0165 M^{-1}$ for retrograde motion. Furthermore, imposing the observed jet precession period, we obtain a significantly tighter constraint, $B\\lesssim 0.0145 M^{-1}$, providing a new constrain on the magnetic field of M87* independent of the shadow. Our results provide unified constraints on the parameters of the KBR black hole and demonstrate that the jet precession offers a robust and complementary probe of magnetized black holes in the strong gravity regime."}

The updated SED modeling reveals S1 to be a very dust- and gas-rich system with a moderate star formation rate and a long gas depletion time ($τ_{\\rm dep} \\sim 1.4$ Gyr), deviating from SMGs and OFGs, but more closely resembling typical massive main-sequence galaxies. We note that, although this revision reduces the number of ultra-massive galaxies reported in Xiao et al. 2024, it does not alter the main conclusions of that work. Overall, our study clarifies the nature of S1 and underscores the importance of multi-line spectroscopic confirmation, slitless observations at multiple position angles, and IFU data for robust redshift and physical characterization of rare massive galaxies in the early Universe."}

In this study, using spatially resolved spectroscopic data from the SAMI Galaxy Survey, we identify galaxies undergoing or recently affected by RPS in eight nearby clusters ($0.029 < z < 0.058$), through a visual classification scheme based on the ionised gas ($\\rm Hα+ [NII]λ6584$) morphologies, split into unperturbed, asymmetric, and truncated. The projected phase-space analysis shows that asymmetric galaxies are found in a narrow region in cluster-centric distance ($\\rm 0.1 < R/R_{200} < 0.6$) and have a larger dispersion in line-of-sight velocity ($σ(|v_{pec}|)_\\mathrm{Asym} = 0.71^{+0.09}_{-0.07}\\ σ_{200}$) compared to the truncated and unperturbed samples. In terms of star formation activity, RPS candidates yield a much steeper resolved star-forming main sequence (rSFMS; $Σ_\\mathrm{SFR} - Σ_\\ast$) relation compared to the unperturbed counterparts, primarily emerging from having lower $Σ_\\mathrm{SFR}$ values for the low mass density regime, with the steepest gradient deriving from the truncated sample. Moreover, radial star formation profiles reveal that star formation in RPS candidates is suppressed in the outskirts relative to unperturbed galaxies and is more prominent for the truncated sample. In contrast, central ($\\rm r/r_{eff}<0.5$) star formation activity in RPS candidates is comparable with that in their unperturbed and field counterparts, suggesting no elevated activity. Taken together, this suggests an evolutionary trend linked to the RPS stage, where unperturbed galaxies likely represent recently accreted systems (pre-RPS), while asymmetric and truncated galaxies may correspond to populations undergoing RPS and post-RPS phases, respectively, favouring outside-in quenching."}

The molecular abundances relative to CH$_3$OH are similar to those of another outer Galactic hot core, demonstrating that chemically rich hot cores exist in different regions of the outer Galaxy. We also compared molecular abundances among hot cores in the inner Galaxy, outer Galaxy, and Magellanic Clouds. This comparison revealed that the metallicity-corrected $N$(SO$_2$)/$N$(H$_2$) ratios of outer Galactic hot cores are significantly lower than those of the inner Galactic ones, while their $N$(CH$_3$OH)/$N$(H$_2$) ratios are similar. The Magellanic hot cores show different trends despite having metallicities similar to those of the outer Galaxy, indicating that the chemical complexity of hot cores is governed by environmental conditions (e.g., cosmic ray intensity and dust temperature) rather than simple metallicity scaling. These environmental differences would also affect the production efficiency of COMs derived from CH$_3$OH, as the $N$(CH$_3$OCH$_3$)/$N$(CH$_3$OH) and $N$(C$_2$H$_5$OH)/$N$(CH$_3$OH) ratios in the outer Galactic sources are moderately lower than those of inner Galactic sources.

Our goal is to assess the feasibility of developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can distinguish between mergers and non-mergers based on LSST-like deep images.

After applying data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning, a CNN model was developed with an accuracy of 65--67\\%.

In this work, we construct a novel exact black hole solution embedded in this Dehnen halo and investigate its physical consequences. The influence of the halo on black hole thermodynamics is analyzed through the mass function, entropy, Hawking temperature, heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy, allowing us to assess both local and global thermodynamic stability of the black hole-dark matter system. Our results show that the presence of a Dehnen-type halo not only stabilizes the otherwise thermodynamically unstable Schwarzschild black hole but also induces phase transitions. In addition, we study null geodesics to examine photon motion, the shadow radius and the optical appearance of the system. The dark matter halo modifies the effective potential, leading to observable changes in the photon sphere and the apparent size of the shadow. We also explore the instability of circular null geodesics and its relation to quasinormal modes in an eikonal limit. These findings highlight the significant role of realistic dark matter distributions in shaping both the thermodynamic behavior and the observable signatures of black holes, providing further insight into the interplay between dark matter halos and central black holes in galaxies."}

We investigate this effect using simulations from the Latte project, a simulation suite from the Feedback In Realistic Environments 2 (FIRE-2) Project. By comparing simulations with and without an LMC-analog interaction, we show that fully cosmological LMC interactions create prominent velocity asymmetry in the stellar halo of the MW, resulting from both barycentric displacement (the \"reflex motion\") and the dynamical wake of the LMC. The strength and direction of this asymmetry depend on the mass ratio at pericenter and orbit of the LMC analog. We perform a spherical-harmonic decomposition of the velocities of halo star particles to confirm that the identified signatures are LMC-induced and persist even when LMC star particles are removed. We also show that this strategy separates and individually detects the dipole (l=1) of the global reflex motion and the quadrupole (l=2) of the local wake. These asymmetries are consistent with those identified in previous work using non-cosmological simulations; the dipole is easily distinguishable from other complex halo substructure using spherical harmonics while the quadrupole is sometimes confused. These findings support the detectability of MW--LMC interaction signatures in upcoming observational surveys of the MW stellar halo."}

Our claim is based on the thorough study of the energy conditions showing the violations of all of them for a FTPR, and only the dominant energy one for an SFS. Application of the so-called Raychaudhuri averaging shows that, alike within the requirement of geodesic completeness, these singularities are weak in the sense of this definition.

In this third paper in a series, we investigate how the strength of narrow interstellar absorption lines in low-resolution spectra varies with SN type and host galaxy properties, both on local and global scales. Using a dataset of over 10000 spectra from $\\sim1800$ low-redshift SNe, we find that Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) in passive galaxies exhibit significantly weaker narrow absorption features compared to CC-SNe and SNe Ia in star-forming hosts (SNe Ia-SF), suggesting lower interstellar gas content in quiescent environments. Within the star-forming hosts, the Na I D equivalent-width distribution of SNe II is much lower than that of both SNe Ia-SF and stripped-envelope SNe (SE-SNe). This result is somewhat unexpected, since CC-SNe are generally associated with star-forming regions and occur deeper within galactic disks, where stronger line-of-sight extinction would be anticipated. This suggests that the observed behaviour cannot be explained solely by absorption from the integrated interstellar medium (ISM) along the line of sight. Instead, if part of the absorption arises from material near the explosion, the similarity between the Na I D EW distributions of SNe Ia-SF and SE-SNe implies that comparable absorption signatures can emerge from distinct progenitor pathways. Possible explanations include (a) circumstellar material (CSM) expelled by the progenitor system before explosion, or (b) interaction of SN radiation with nearby patchy ISM clouds. Our results highlight the diagnostic power of interstellar absorption features in revealing the diverse environments and progenitor pathways of SNe."}

Here we construct an infinite set of Dirac observables for Gowdy cosmologies, valid off-shell, strongly, and without gauge fixing. These observables stay regular at the Big Bang and can be matched to much simpler Dirac observables of the Carroll-type gravity theory.

Methanol forms early in these environments following CO freeze-out via successive hydrogenation reactions on grain surfaces, while the production of deuterated methanol requires elevated gas-phase D/H ratios generated through dissociative recombination of deuterated H3+. Consequently, large abundances of deuterated methanol are observed toward young stellar objects where prestellar ices have recently sublimated. Here, we present laboratory infrared spectra of methanol and its deuterated isotopologues in astrophysical ice analogues, complemented by anharmonic vibrational calculations used to guide band assignments. Experiments were performed at the CASICE laboratory using a Bruker Vertex 70v spectrometer coupled to a closed-cycle helium cryostat, with isotopologue ices deposited at 10 K under high-vacuum conditions. Infrared transmission spectra were recorded over 6000-30 cm-1 (1.67-333 um) and compared with spectra of pure isotopologue ices. Distinctive mid-infrared band patterns are identified for each deuterated species. In particular, CH2DOH exhibits a characteristic doublet at 1293 and 1326 cm-1 (7.73 and 7.54 um), while CHD2OH shows a similar doublet at 1301 and 1329 cm-1 (7.69 and 7.52 um), both remaining largely invariant across all studied ice mixtures.

Using the scale factor ansatz $α(t)=\\left(\\fracαη+t^2\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2 η}}$, we reconstruct the scalar field potential $V(t)$, and observe a smooth potential well centered at the bounce point. The resulting energy density, pressure, and equation-of-state parameter show NEC violation necessary for successful bounce, while viscosity controls post-bounce dynamics with a positive and smooth squared speed of sound. In contrast, for the non-viscous model, sharp divergences occur just at the bounce and continues to be negative in the expanding phase, which in turn emphasises the stabilising role of dissipative effects. The energy condition analysis indicates a temporary NEC and SEC violation in the viscous scenario, whereas its persistent violation within the non-viscous model suggests a continuous accelerated expansion. Observational viability is found through Bayesian MCMC fitting in regards to the Pantheon+ supernova data, with best-fit parameters providing a reduced chi-squared of $χ_{red}^2 =0.995$ while the inflation observables derived from the reconstructed potential place our model predictions inside $68\\%$ CL Planck 2018 confidence contours.

The PAH emission power spectra are highly anisotropic. They are well fitted with a break-free power-law, suggesting that we do not observe a specific scale for energy dissipation. Power-law indices are -3.5 near Merope and -3 in the more distant field. The magnetic field orientation, as derived from the Planck dust polarization data, aligns with the PAH anisotropy. The power anisotropy is constant across scales. These findings are discussed in relation to interstellar turbulence that may be driven by the Pleiades stars. The JWST observations of the Pleiades offer a new viewpoint for comparing observations and theoretical models, as they examine physical scales at which turbulence in the CNM is subsonic and decoupled from the thermal instability. The observations may indicate that the turbulent energy cascade in the CNM is anisotropic."}

How can we reasonably assess a theory that describes such a mostly unobservable universe? We propose a Bayesian method based on theory-generated probability distributions for our observations. We focus on basic principles, leaving aside concerns about practicality. (We also leave aside the measure problem, to discuss other issues.) We argue that cosmological theories can be tested by standard Bayesian updating, but we need to use theoretical predictions for \"first-person\" probabilities -- i.e., probabilities for our observations, accounting for all relevant selection effects. These selection effects can depend on the observer, and on time, so in principle first-person probabilities are defined for each observer-instant -- an observer at an instant of time. First-person probabilities should take into account everything the observer believes about herself and her surroundings -- i.e., her \"subjective state\". We advocate a \"Principle of Self-Locating Indifference\" (PSLI), asserting that any real observer should make predictions as if she were chosen randomly from the theoretically predicted observer-instants that share her subjective state. We believe the PSLI is intuitively very reasonable, but also argue that it maximizes the expected fraction of observers who will make correct predictions. Cosmological theories will in general predict a set of possible universes, each with a probability. To calculate first-person probabilities, we argue that each possible universe should be weighted by the number of observer-instants in the specified subjective state that it contains. We also discuss Boltzmann brains, the humans/Jovians parable of Hartle and Srednicki, and the use of \"old evidence\"."}

We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium-Resolution Spectrometer observations of two nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), F11119+3257 and F05189-2524, with nuclear X-ray detected UFOs and kiloparsec-scale outflow. These galaxies show remarkably similar mid-infrared continuum and emission line features, notably including a high-velocity $v_{90}$ $\\sim$ 4000 km s$^{-1}$ outflow detected in highly ionized neon emission lines, e.g., \\nevi. In F05189-2524, we see a slightly slower biconical outflow extending up to $\\sim2$ kpc in the same neon emission lines. Both sources show evidence of AGN-driven radiative feedback through a deficit of rotational molecular hydrogen lines in the nuclear region, $<$1 kpc from the central quasar, but no clear evidence of any molecular gas entrained in the quasar-driven outflow. Energetic analysis shows that the warm ionized gas in both of these sources contributes minimally ($\\sim0.1-5\\%$) to the momentum outflow rate of these sources and leaves the conclusions of previous literature unchanged: the energetics of these sources are broadly consistent with a momentum-conserving outflow."}

In this work, we probe GR deviations via a $μ$-$Σ$ modified gravity parameterization, integrating KiDS-Legacy weak lensing (1347 deg$^2$, $z\\leq 2.0$), joint CMB data (Planck/ACT/SPT), DESI DR2 BAO, and DES-Dovekie supernovae. KiDS-Legacy significantly improves constraint precision: $μ_0$ (matter clustering) by $\\sim 43\\%$ and $Σ_0$ (gravitational light deflection) by $\\sim 60\\%$ relative to CMB alone. In the $Λ$CDM background, $μ_0 = 0.21\\pm 0.21$ is consistent with GR, while $Σ_0 = 0.149\\pm 0.051$ deviates from GR at the 3.0$σ$ level -- attributed to large-scale CMB lensing from ACT/SPT. This precise separation of GR-consistent matter clustering and deviant light deflection provides key observational clues for new physics or data systematics. Our work underscores the critical role of synergizing high-precision CMB and WL data in advancing GR tests."}

Recent measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and stacks of X-ray emission from optically selected galaxy clusters suggest that feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is more efficient at expelling gas from low-mass clusters than previously thought. The measurement of the cross-correlation between cosmic shear and diffuse X-ray emission provides a new probe of the distribution of gas in groups and clusters. We use the FLAMINGO cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations to examine the X-ray--cosmic-shear cross-correlation. The cross-correlation is most sensitive to the distribution of gas in haloes with masses $10^{14}\\leq M_{200\\mathrm{c}}/\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}\\leq10^{15}$. It is sensitive to the strength of feedback, but the effects of variations in cosmology and baryonic physics are largely degenerate. We compare the FLAMINGO predictions with the cross-correlation between cosmic shear from the Dark Energy Survey and ROSAT all-sky X-ray maps. We find that, if we neglect the X-ray emission from AGN that would remain unresolved by ROSAT, then the fiducial FLAMINGO model is in excellent agreement with the data, while models with stronger or weaker feedback are ruled out. However, if we account for unresolved AGN, either using the direct FLAMINGO predictions or by abundance matching to the observed (extrapolated) AGN luminosity function, then models with stronger feedback are preferred. We conclude that to exploit the potential of the X-ray--lensing cross-correlation, it will be necessary to resolve fainter AGN, and to use external constraints to break the degeneracy between baryonic feedback and cosmology."}
