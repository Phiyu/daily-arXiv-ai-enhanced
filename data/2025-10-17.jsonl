In this context, we present a major update to the Monte Carlo\nradiative transfer code COLT to facilitate self-consistent modelling of nebular\nline and continuum emission from simulated galaxies. We introduce a new thermal\nequilibrium solver that iteratively couples to the existing ionization solver\nand radiation field to compute effective gas temperatures by accurately\nbalancing photoionization heating, radiative and dielectronic recombination,\ncollisional ionization, charge exchange, metal and primordial line cooling,\nfree-free emission, and Compton scattering. To prevent over-cooling where\nnon-equilibrium hydrodynamics dominate, we introduce a Courant-limited cooling\nprescription tied to each cell's sound-crossing time, preserving temperatures\nin the diffuse halo while allowing physically motivated cooling in the\ninterstellar medium (ISM). Applied to an isolated local galaxy simulation, the\nequilibrium solver reshapes the ISM phase space by reducing spuriously\nexcessive lukewarm ($T=10^3-10^4$K) gas and better resolving warm ionized and\ncold neutral phases, while leaving the CGM largely intact. We further implement\na level population solver based on modern atomic data, enabling accurate\ncooling and emissivities for a large library of UV to infrared metal lines,\ntogether with newly implemented primordial nebular continuum emission from\nfree-free, free-bound, and two-photon processes. Finally, by applying COLT to\nthe high-redshift THESAN-ZOOM simulations, we reproduce observed emission-line\nratios, establishing COLT as a robust framework for forward modelling nebular\nemission across cosmic time."}

One open\nquestion is the driving mechanism of galaxy-scale outflows. At low redshift,\nradio jets often interact with the ISM, generating turbulence and driving\nionized outflows. Despite this evidence at low redshift, relatively few studies\nhave investigated the radio-ionized gas connection at cosmic noon. Thus, our\nmain goal is to conduct a pilot study using VLA data for three quasars with\nmoderate/high radio power, which have ionized outflows identified in\nobservations from the SUPER survey. We used [OIII] data from SINFONI analyzed\nin earlier studies, along with new 6.2 GHz VLA radio observations, at\ncomparable spatial resolution. We also incorporate radio data from the\nliterature to explore the radio emission. We detected extended radio structure\nin our VLA A-array data for two quasars. The extended structure in J1333+1649\naligns with the smaller-scale emission seen in archival images, suggesting a\njet propagating from nuclear to galaxy-wide scales. In all three quasars, we\nfound that the brightest radio emission and ionized gas have comparable spatial\nscales. Furthermore, the position angles of the radio emission and ionized gas\npresent small offsets for the two targets with extended structures. Given that\nthe kinematics of the ionized gas in all three quasars is dominated by\noutflows, our results suggest a strong connection between radio emission and\nionized outflows in typical AGN at cosmic noon. Based on energetic\nconsiderations and comparisons with archival data, radio jets could be a\nsignificant mechanism for driving outflows in AGN from cosmic noon to low\nredshifts.

Detailed analysis of their properties allows us to probe the\nactivity history of the galactic nucleus and, potentially, other properties of\nthe host galaxy. A recent paper presents detailed radial velocity profiles of\noutflows in ten AGN host galaxies and shows a common trend of approximately\nconstant velocity in the centre followed by rapid acceleration outside $R_{\\rm\ntr} \\sim 1 - 3$ kpc. We show that this is a consequence of the AGN-driven\noutflows clearing the gaseous bulges of the host galaxies and beginning to\nexpand into a region of negligible gas density. We used a 1D semi-analytical\ncode to calculate outflow propagation in each of the ten galaxies, assuming a\nconstant AGN luminosity and an isothermal bulge density profile, with a finite\nbulge radius, and leaving the gas fraction and total mass of the bulge as free\nparameters. We also considered the effect of different gas density profiles,\nvariations in bulge velocity dispersion, AGN luminosity, and the effect of\noutflow fragmentation. Our simplest model can fit six outflow profiles\nessentially perfectly, while another can be fit if the bulge gas density\nprofile is shallower than isothermal. A shallower density profile also improves\nthe fit in the central regions of the remaining three outflows, but they\naccelerate faster than our models predict; this could be evidence of\nsignificant gas cooling and star formation that reduce the total mass of\noutflowing gas. We conclude that a simple AGN-driven wind feedback model can\nexplain the detailed velocity profiles of real outflows in local AGN hosts. The\nfree parameters of our model have values that fall well within reasonable\nranges. This suggests that the simple scenario we envisioned is close to the\ntrue conditions governing the general trends of large-scale outflow expansion."}

J. Geom. Meth. Mod Phys", "summary": "We present an exact analytical study of Klein-Gordon (KG) scalar bosons and\nantibosons confined in the Bonnor-Melvin (BM) spacetime under a uniform\nmagnetic field, incorporating rainbow gravity (RG) corrections with a positive\ncosmological constant. The cosmological constant partitions spacetime into an\ninfinite sequence of confinement domains bounded by impenetrable barriers.\nWithin the first allowed domain, the KG equation reduces to a hypergeometric\ndifferential equation, yielding closed-form expressions for both the energy\nspectra and the radial wavefunctions in terms of hypergeometric polynomials.\nTwo representative RG models, inspired by the Magueijo-Smolin framework and\nloop quantum gravity (LQG), produce Planck-scale bounded, symmetric\nparticle-antiparticle spectra. A distinctive feature of the curved magnetized\ngeometry is the collapse of all magnetic quantum states $m \\neq 0$ onto the $m\n= 0$ level for each radial excitation, a degeneracy absent in flat spacetime.\nIncreasing the cosmological constant partially lifts this collapse,\nestablishing a direct link between the global spacetime curvature and the local\nquantum structure. Radial probability density analysis further shows that\nstronger magnetic fields enhance spatial localization, confining bosons into\nstatic or rotating ring-like configurations with nodal architectures that\nevolve systematically with quantum numbers. These findings reveal how\ngravitational confinement, topology, magnetic fields, and Planck-scale\ncorrections jointly govern the spectral and spatial properties of relativistic\nquantum fields in curved and magnetized backgrounds."}

Submitted for review to MNRAS", "summary": "Galactic outflows are a key agent of galaxy evolution, yet their observed\nmultiphase nature remains difficult to reconcile with theoretical models, which\noften fail to explain how cold gas survives interactions with hot, fast winds.\nWe present high-resolution 3D hydrodynamic simulations of hot outflows\ninteracting with a multiphase interstellar medium (ISM), parameterised by its\ncold-gas volume filling fraction $f_v$, depth $L_{\\rm ISM}$, and clump size\n$r_{\\rm cl}$. We identify a universal survival criterion $f_v L_{\\rm ISM}\n\\gtrsim r_{\\rm crit}$ that generalises the classical single-cloud condition\n($r_{\\rm cl} > r_{\\rm crit}$) and correctly predicts cold-gas survival across\ndiverse ISM configurations - including scale-free - down to $r_{\\rm cl}/r_{\\rm\ncrit} \\sim 10^{-2}$. The surviving cold phase rapidly loses memory of the\ninitial ISM structure and evolves toward a self-similar clump mass spectrum\nfollowing Zipf's law ($\\mathrm{d}N/\\mathrm{d}m \\propto m^{-2}$), implying that\nturbulent mixing and radiative condensation universally shape multiphase\noutflows. Cold gas assembles into plumes or confined shells of size $\\sim \\chi\nr_{\\mathrm{cl,min}}$, growing as mass is accreted from the hot phase. The\ninteraction of a laminar wind with a clumpy ISM drives turbulence in both\nphases, with first-order velocity structure functions following a Kolmogorov\nscaling and an injection scale set by $L_{\\rm ISM}$, while velocity dispersions\nreach $\\sigma \\sim c_{\\rm s,cold}$. The areal covering fraction of cold gas\napproaches unity even for $f_v \\sim 10^{-3}$, though its volume filling\nfraction stays low, explaining the \"misty\" appearance of observed outflows.\nTogether, these results link small-scale cloud-wind interactions to\ngalaxy-scale feedback, and we discuss their implications for interpreting\nobservations and for modelling multiphase galactic winds in larger-scale\nsimulations."}

As the\nupcoming wide-field surveys can potentially continue to increase the number of\nknown streams, there is a growing need to shift focus from manual detection of\nindividual streams to automated detection methods that prioritize both quality\nand quantity. Traditional techniques rely heavily on the visual expectation\nthat GC streams are dynamically cold and thin.

As a result, these methods are biased toward a\nsubset of the whole stream population, with often unquantified purity and\ncompleteness. In this work, we present StarStream, an automatic stream\ndetection algorithm based on a physics-inspired model rather than visual\nexpectation. Our method provides a more accurate prediction of stream stars in\nthe multi-dimensional space of observables, while using fewer free parameters\nto account for the diversity of streams.
