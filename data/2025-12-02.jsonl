Focusing on dynamical Chern-Simons gravity as a paradigm for parity violation, we perturb the Schwarzschild background with a localized potential bump. Our analysis reveals three distinctive phenomena absent in general relativity: 1) topological reconnections of mode branches, 2) counterintuitive mode stabilization that delays overtaking transitions, and 3) scalar mode dominance emerging at intermediate coupling strengths. These dynamical features amplify weak static splittings into observable signatures, establishing a connection between gravitational symmetry breaking and non-Hermitian spectral physics.

Starting from a canonical Lagrangian for radial metric functions and the curvature scalar $R$, we derive the associated Hamiltonian and show that the Legendre map is regular whenever both the first derivative of $f(R)$ with respect to $R$ and the second derivative with respect to $R$ is non-zero. Within Noether's approach (variational and Lie-derivative forms), we obtain general, canonical, and internal symmetry classes and identify explicit generators; for the quadratic model $f(R)=R^{2}$ these include radial translations and scaling symmetries. We then formulate Mei symmetry conditions as invariance of the Euler--Lagrange equations under the first prolongation, which yields an overdetermined partial differential equation (PDE) system for the generator components. Solving this system for $f(R)=R^{2}$, we find eight independent Mei generators and construct the corresponding conserved currents, some without a direct Noether analog. The analysis demonstrates that Mei symmetries extend the standard Noether framework for higher-order Lagrangians and provide additional conserved quantities relevant to black-hole dynamics in modified gravity. We conclude with a comparison of the two symmetry schemes and outline applications to broader $f(R)$ models and to rotating spacetimes."}

Models of such binaries also serve as useful tools for understanding the dynamics of compact binary systems and the gravitational waves they emit. Using an eccentric Ori-Thorne procedure developed in previous work, we build worldlines that describe the full inspiral and plunge of a small body on an initially eccentric orbit of a Kerr black hole. We now calculate the gravitational waves associated with these trajectories using a code that solves the Teukolsky equation in the time domain. The final cycles of these waveforms, the ringdown, contains a superposition of Kerr quasinormal modes followed by a power-law tail. In this paper, we study how a binary's eccentricity and orbital anomaly angle affect the excitation of both quasinormal modes and late-time tails. We find that the relative excitation of quasinormal modes varies in an important and interesting way with these parameters. For some anomaly angles, the relative excitations of quasinormal modes are essentially indistinguishable from those excited in quasi-circular coalescences. Consistent with other recent studies, we find that eccentricity tends to amplify the late-time power-law tail, though the amount of this amplification varies significantly with orbital anomaly. We thus find that eccentricity has an important impact on the late-time coalescence waveform, but the interplay of eccentricity and orbit anomaly complicates this impact."}

While the best-fit suggests deviation, results remain consistent with General Relativity ($α=0$) within the $2σ$ confidence level. Based on these constraints, we model the secular mass accretion history (treating accretion efficiency as a phenomenological constant) and compute the shadow radius evolution. We find that in a realistic dispersive plasma environment, refractive effects significantly mask intrinsic gravitational and dark energy signatures, causing global shadow shrinkage.

The source can be a massive star (with or without disc) with a HII region or a G-type T Tauri star with a photo-evaporating disc, embedded in a molecular envelope. We obtained a map of the OI line at 63 micron with 6\" angular resolution and employed archival data of the CII 158 micron line (14\" resolution), using the upGREAT heterodyne receiver aboard SOFIA. We also collected IRAM 30m CO data at 1mm (11\" resolution). All the lines were detected across the whole object. The peak integrated OI emission of ~5 K km/s is located ~10\" west of an embedded YSO. The OI and CII data near the source show bulk emission at ~11 km/s and a line wing at ~13 km/s, while the 12CO 2-1 data reveal additional blue-shifted high-velocity emission. The KOSMA-tau PDR model can explain the emissions in the tail with a low external UV field (<350 Go, mostly consistent with our UV field estimates), but not at the location of the YSO. There, the high line intensities and increased line widths for all lines and a possible bipolar CO outflow suggest the presence of a protostellar disc. However, the existence of a thermal HII region, revealed by combining existing and new radio continuum data, points towards a massive star - and not a T Tauri-type one. We derived molecular and atomic gas masses of ~20 Msun and a few Msun, respectively. The photo-evaporation (only considering external illumination) lifetime of 1.6x10^5 yrs is shorter than the free-fall lifetime of 5.2x10^5 yrs; thus, we find that proplyd #7 might not have had the time to produce many more stars."}

We explore how numerical resolution, the level of local disk stability, and the presence of a live halo influence both the initial appearance and the subsequent evolution of these modes. To characterize spiral structure, we compute Fourier amplitudes for modes $m=1$-$6$. In marginally unstable, lower-resolution disks ($N_\\star=5\\times10^6$, $N_{\\rm DM}=1.14\\times10^7$), faint features appear within the first $0.5$ Gyr due to numerical noise, in contrast to high-resolution models where perturbations emerge later. Across all sufficiently resolved, live-halo models with $m_{\\rm DM}/m_\\star \\le 10$, the spirals exhibit a cascading sequence in both mode number and radius: higher-$m$ modes form and decay first, followed by the delayed emergence of lower-$m$ modes, with an inward drift of the activity's epicenter. This behavior reflects a combination of local swing amplification, which explains the initial growth of short-wavelength modes, and interference between coexisting long-lived spiral modes, which accounts for the recurrent short-timescale amplitude modulations. In contrast, models with a fixed halo potential or coarse halo resolution ($N_{\\rm DM}=1.14\\times10^6$ and $m_{\\rm DM}/m_\\star=100$) show strong early spirals but lack this coherent cascading behavior, owing to excessive shot noise and insufficient halo responsiveness. The $m=3$ mode plays a transitional role, marking the onset of angular-momentum transport in the inner disk that precedes bar formation, a process absent in fixed-potential models. Our results show that a live halo with appropriate mass resolution provides the gravitational response needed to sustain and regenerate multi-mode spiral structure, even though the total angular-momentum exchange remains small."}

In this work, we combine internally reconstructed CMB lensing maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 with galaxy samples from unWISE and a map of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) fluctuations from Planck to produce a well-correlated tracer of the CMB lensing field. Our co-added tracer, shown to be 55-85% correlated with the true lensing convergence at multipoles $L \\leq 2000$, is then convolved with ACT DR6 $E$-mode polarization to yield a template of the lensing $B$-modes. We assess its performance on a wide range of scales by using it to delens ACT DR6 and Planck $B$-modes over 23% of the sky, removing around 39% of the lensing power at $100\\leq l \\leq 1500$ and 47% at $30 \\leq l \\leq 300$, respectively.

We investigate the prevalence of such cold streams in IllustrisTNG-50 over the range z=4-0, using a novel algorithm to automatically detect cold streams in simulated halos. We qualitatively and quantitatively characterize the geometric and physical properties of the detected streams over cosmic time. We find that cold streams are ubiquitous in massive halos at cosmic noon, occurring in more than 80 percent of such systems down to z=1, before becoming rare by z=0. At their peak prevalence (z=2-1), streams are often found in roughly co-planar, three-stream configurations. These streams generally exhibit a dense and cool core, surrounded by a diffuse and warmer envelope. However, we find that in IllustrisTNG-50, these streams typically disrupt in the outer halo and do not penetrate efficiently to the central galaxy, with the total mass inflow from streams peaking at z=2. Our results underscore the importance of cold streams in fueling galaxies at early times, but they highlight the need for higher-resolution simulations to fully capture their survival and impact at later epochs.

LRD sample and measurements are publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17665942", "summary": "We use the DAWN JWST Archive to construct and characterise a sample of 116 little red dots (LRDs) across 2.3<z<9.3, selecting all sources with v-shaped UV-optical continua from NIRSpec/PRISM spectra and compact morphologies in NIRCam/F444W imaging. We show that LRD continuum spectra are ubiquitously well described by modified blackbodies across ~$0.4-1.0μ$m, with typical T~5000K or $λ_{peak}$~$0.65μ$m across 2 dex in luminosity, and a tail toward T~2000K. LRDs therefore trace a locus in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram that is directly analogous to stars on the Hayashi track, strongly supporting the picture that LRDs are AGN embedded in thermalised dense gas envelopes in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium. Hotter LRDs with $λ_{peak}<0.65μ$m typically have strong Balmer breaks, redder UV slopes and high optical luminosities; other LRDs show weak or no Balmer breaks, and wide variety in $β_{UV}$ and $L_{5100}$. Crucially, we demonstrate that the UV-optical continuum shapes and luminosities are strongly linked to the $Hα,\\ Hβ$, [OIII] and OI line properties. There is a tight linear relation between the H$α$ and optical continuum luminosities, as well as H$α$ and OI$_{8446}$, indicating that Balmer, OI and optical emission must primarily be powered by the same source. The Balmer decrement increases strongly toward higher $L_{Hα}$, $L_{5100}$ and Balmer break strength, providing key evidence for luminosity-dependent effects of collisional (de-)excitation and resonant scattering in the gaseous envelopes. In contrast, we show that [OIII] emission likely originates from star-forming host galaxies, and that its strong correlation with Balmer break strength arises naturally from variation in the AGN-to-host ratio. Our work presents an empirical description of the nature and structure of LRDs, defining a new benchmark for ongoing LRD model developments."}

Building upon these foundational theories, we obtain the trajectory of the plasma and the temporal evolution of the hotspot images. It is found that there are three flares within the observing time, which is driven by the Comisso-Asenjo mechanism. We also discuss the influence of the cosmological parameter on the hotspot imaging.

We report the first detailed analysis of the giant radio halo in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 2163, using upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) and Very Large Array (VLA) observations. Combining radio data (300-1400 MHz) with archival X-ray data offers a unique opportunity to study the complex ICM physics of the cluster. The sensitive uGMRT observations map the halo emission for the first time out to an extent of ~3.3 Mpc, up to $r_{500}$, and also effectively recover other diffuse sources. The radio surface brightness profile is well fitted with an exponential function up to r$_{500}$, with an evolution of e-folding radius over frequencies (larger at low frequencies). The spatially resolved spectral index map reveals fluctuations and outward radial steepening of the average spectral index. Radio and X-ray surface brightness are well correlated, with a correlation slope of $\\sim$0.70 for the halo, and $\\sim$0.40 for the ridge. The correlation slope varies from cluster centre to outskirts, suggesting the magnetic field and thermal gas density scaling relation (B $\\propto n_{e}^{0.5}$) should be reassessed, provided that the re-acceleration efficiency is constant. We propose that diffuse lobes at the periphery could serve as a reservoir for seed electrons, behind the radio halo emission, with an estimated acceleration efficiency reaching $\\sim$0.1% in the external regions. Additionally, a major E-W merger is suggested, leading to turbulence in the ICM and generating the halo."}

This catalogue will be updated with future data releases, offering a growing resource for the study of emission-line galaxies. To obtain reliable emission-line fluxes from narrow-band photometry, we employed spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using CIGALE, a robust tool that reconstructs the continuum emission and ensures accurate flux measurements. This method effectively mitigates uncertainties associated with direct continuum subtraction techniques, and systematics such as absorption components in the emission lines. We validate our approach using simulated observations of galaxy spectra with added noise, testing the method's performance across different equivalent width (EW) regimes and emission-line strengths. Additionally, we compare the recovered emission-line fluxes with spectroscopic measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our results show a tight correlation between photometric and spectroscopic fluxes, particularly for bright emission lines, with a typical dispersion of $\\sim$0.3 dex.

This classification of singular points where both Stokes parameters $Q$ and $U$ vanish stems from the fact that linear polarization is described by a second-rank tensor. By varying the number of spherical harmonics included in the polarization maps, one can probe the statistics of these singularities across a range of angular scales. Applying this method to Planck data we find clear evidence of non-Gaussianity in both $E$ and $B$ modes of polarization. This approach may be especially useful for processing data from current and future experiments such as the Simons Observatory (SO). In particular, it can help to assess the Gaussianity of a potentially detected B mode signal, thereby determining whether it arises from primordial tensor perturbations -- as predicted by inflation -- or from alternative sources such as polarized foregrounds (e.g., thermal dust), E-to-B mode leakage, systematics, photon noise or gravitational lensing.

We demonstrate that these extended objects generate distinctive signatures that depart markedly from point-mass lenses like primordial black holes. The smoking-gun signature for these exotic objects is the emergence of caustics, which form when the lens radius is below a critical threshold. Crossing these caustics induces discontinuous jumps in the images-centroid trajectory, a distinctive feature of these extended dark objects. We show these patterns are sensitive to the internal mass profile, with boson stars generating larger, more prominent caustic structures than Q-balls -- enabling the models to be distinguished. Using the Gaia DR3 stellar catalogue, we forecast a high-yield discovery potential, up to $\\sim 6000$ detectable astrometric microlensing events for a 10-year mission, peaking for $M \\sim 1-10~M_\\odot$ and $R \\lesssim 10~\\text{AU}$.

Linking the kSZ power spectrum to the properties of ionising sources would provide an opportunity to use such observations to access astrophysical and cosmological information from the Epoch of Reionisation, including the morphology of ionised regions, while simultaneously improving CMB analyses. The aim of this work is to assess this potential of the kSZ power spectrum to measure reionisation-era galaxy properties. We repurpose the publicly available LoReLi II simulations, which track the evolution of neutral hydrogen during reionisation, to generate a training set of patchy kSZ angular power spectra. We then train an emulator using neural network regression in order to allow for efficient Bayesian inference, and conduct forecasts assuming mock observations from current and future CMB experiments. We find that measurements of the kSZ power spectrum from such surveys can provide meaningful constraints on several of the astrophysical model parameters of the LoReLi II suite, including the ionising escape fraction for which we expect a 14% relative error, on average. They also provide an independent measurement of the CMB optical depth, marginalised over the astrophysics and with error bars competitive with the cosmic variance limit from large scale surveys. The kSZ power spectrum offers a promising avenue for probing the properties of reionisation-era galaxies and providing an independent measurement of the CMB optical depth with upcoming CMB experiments. Since the error budget of our mock observations is dominated by emulator reconstruction errors, we expect our results could be further improved with a more extended simulation training set."}

In Wald's classic analysis (Wald 1974), which was based on the assumption of vanishing injection energy, the black hole was predicted to acquire a universal \"saturation charge\" $Q_{\\mathrm{w}}=2B_{0}J$. However, the physical mechanism that sets the saturation charge must ultimately be governed by the competition between the absorption rates of positively and negatively charged particles. Motivated by this observation, we revisit the problem in the framework of a simple accretion model, where two dilute, equivalent fluxes of charged particles of opposite signs are injected from infinity along the magnetic field lines. The problem then reduces to that of individual particle motion in the electromagnetic field of the magnetized Kerr black hole. Using a combination of numerical and analytical tools, we determine the domains of absorption and establish both lower and upper bounds on the corresponding absorption cross sections. At $Q=Q_\\mathrm{w}$ these bounds reveal a systematic difference between the two charge signs. In particular, for sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the lower bound on the absorption cross section for the \"attracted\" charge exceeds the upper bound for the \"repelled\" one. This charge accretion imbalance (which we find to become extreme at the limit of large $B_{0}$) indicates a persistent net charge accretion at $Q=Q_{\\mathrm{w}}$, implying that the actual saturation charge must differ from Wald's charge $Q_{\\mathrm{w}}$."}

We aim to understand the relationship between the power of AGN feedback and the cooling of gas in the centres of galaxy clusters by correlating the radio properties of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) with the X-ray properties of their host clusters. We used catalogues from the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) along with ASKAP radio data. In total, we identified 134 radio sources associated with BCGs of the 151 eRASS1 clusters located in the PS1, PS2, and SWAG-X ASKAP fields. Non-detections were treated as upper limits. We correlated BCG radio luminosity, largest linear size (LLS), and BCG offset with the integrated X-ray luminosity of their host clusters. To characterise cool cores (CCs) and non-cool cores (NCCs), we used the concentration parameter $c_{R_{500}}$ and combined it with the BCG offset to assess cluster dynamical state. We analysed the correlation between radio mechanical power and X-ray luminosity within the CC subsample. We observe a potential positive trend between LLS and BCG offset, suggesting an environmental effect on radio-source morphology. We find a weak trend where more luminous central radio galaxies are found in clusters with higher X-ray luminosity. Within the CC subsample, there is a positive but highly scattered relationship between the mechanical luminosity of AGN jets and the X-ray cooling luminosity. This finding is supported by bootstrap resampling and flux-flux analyses. The correlation indicates that AGN feedback is ineffective in high-luminosity (high-mass) clusters. At a cooling luminosity of $L_{\\mathrm{X},~r<R_\\mathrm{cool}}\\approx 5.50\\times10^{43}$ erg/s, on average, AGN feedback appears to contribute only about 13%-22% of the energy needed to offset the radiative losses in the ICM."}

Dust temperatures ($T_{d}$) are determined based on the corresponding galaxy dust masses, independently calculated in our previous work, through a self-consistent method, without the need to actually perform a complete spectral energy distribution (SED) fit of the cold dust emission fluxes. The range and average dust temperatures are found to be consistent within errors with values from other studies. Simultaneously, the dust emissivity indices ($β_{d}$) are determined, and their evolution with temperature quantified, with the $T_{d}$ anti-correlation still being present. It is investigated whether $β_{d}$ can be predicted from other relation or if it scales with other integrated dust / ISM or galaxy property, which could be used as a proxy. In this respect, new and established relations between $T_{d}$, $β_{d}$, the dust surface density and global / integrated galaxy and star-formation related quantities are presented and analysed. We find that SFR, sSFR or $Σ_{SFR}$ are inconclusive traces of the dust temperature. We also find that the extent of dust emission distribution is slightly lower on average, but comparable with the optical stellar continuum emission one. The results and conclusions can be relevant for larger scales studies of low to mid-redshift galaxies from the latest surveys."}

We compute the quasinormal spectrum for both axial \"up\" and \"down\" perturbations using the WKB method and verify the results through time-domain integration. The two sectors are no longer isospectral, and the deviations grow with the halo scale parameter. The grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections are extracted via standard scattering boundary conditions and the WKB approach, and their behaviour is fully consistent with the structure of the effective potentials. Altogether, our analysis demonstrates that a dark-matter halo imprint induces modifications in the gravitational response, while the employed approximation schemes remain sufficiently accurate for quantitative predictions.

We describe the dark energy perturbation within two complementary frameworks, namely the Parameterized Post-Friedmann (PPF) approach and the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of dark energy. Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations together with Planck 2018 CMB data and the Union3 supernova sample, we constrain the effective sound speed of dark energy in both the $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM backgrounds. Within the PPF description, the sound speed remains unconstrained for $w$CDM, while for the $w_0w_a$CDM case we obtain $\\log_{10} c_s^2 = -3.00^{+2.9}_{-0.99}$. Additionally, in the EFT framework, both models favor a small sound speed, with a mean value $c_s^2 \\simeq 0.3$--$0.4$ but with significant uncertainties. For dynamical dark energy, the reconstructed equation of state clearly exhibits a quintom-B behavior, and its deviation from $Λ$CDM reaches $3.42σ$, rising to $3.63σ$ when PPF perturbations are included and reducing to $3.19σ$ in the EFT case. Finally, model comparison using information criteria shows that the $w_0w_a$CDM model with a smooth, non-clustering dark energy component ($c_s^2 = 1$) is preferred by AIC, whereas BIC favors $Λ$CDM. In summary, current data indicate a mild preference for dynamical dark energy but no evidence for significant clustering, which implies the need for future high-precision observations to probe the perturbative behavior more definitively."}

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of six representative DDE parametrization models by utilizing the latest and most precise CMB data jointly from ACT, SPT, and Planck, in conjunction with BAO data from DESI DR2 and SN data from DESY5, PantheonPlus, and Union3. Our overall analysis indicates that the preference for DDE in the Quintom-B regime remains robust, regardless of the DDE parameterization model and the data combination employed. The trend of this preference is significantly strengthened with the support of DESY5 SN data. Specifically, when using the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, for the Barboza-Alcaniz (BA) model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.785 \\pm 0.047$ and $w_a = -0.43^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, which significantly deviate from the $Λ$CDM values and provide evidence for DDE at the $4.2σ$ level. By the reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$, normalized dark energy density $f_{\\mathrm{DE}}(z)$, and the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, we also observe clear departures from $Λ$CDM, further reinforcing the case for DDE.

This study provides a proof of concept for extracting the spatially resolved SFHs of local galaxies with Euclid, highlighting the strengths and limitations of SFH modeling in the context of next-generation galaxy surveys. We used the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code Prospector to model both spatially resolved and global SFHs using parametric and nonparametric configurations. The input consisted of mock ultraviolet--near-infrared photometry derived from the TNG50 cosmological simulation and processed with the radiative transfer code SKIRT. We show that nonparametric SFHs provide a more effective approach to mitigating the outshining effect by recent star formation, offering improved accuracy in the determination of galaxy stellar properties. Also, we find that the nonparametric SFH model at resolved scales closely recovers the stellar mass formation times (within 0.1~dex) and the ground truth values from TNG50, with an absolute average bias of $0.03$~dex in stellar mass and $0.01$~dex in both specific star formation rate and mass-weighted age. In contrast, larger offsets are estimated for all stellar properties and formation times when using a simple $τ$-model SFH, at both resolved and global scales, highlighting its limitations. These results emphasize the critical role of nonparametric SFHs in both global and spatially resolved analyses, as they better capture the complex evolutionary pathways of galaxies and avoid the biases inherent in simple parametric models."}

The case $N=2$ is investigated in detail and a fit to cosmological data is performed where it is found that a better fit is obtained in comparison with the $N=1$ case. The fits also constrain high scale parameters, i.e., the axion decay constant which is determined to be sub-Planckian, a result consistent with string theory that disfavors trans-Planckian axion decay constant. Furthermore, the dark energy-dark matter interaction strength is constrained to be feeble, i.e., $λ\\lesssim 4\\times 10^{-6}$ m$_{\\rm Pl}^{-2}$ Mpc$^{-2}$.

Our analysis focuses on ideal fluid models and extends to spatially flat LFRW cosmologies, providing key equations that govern energy density, pressure, and curvature dynamics. Furthermore, we propose a bouncing cosmological model, in which the universe undergoes cycles of contraction and expansion, avoiding the singularity associated with the Big Bang. Our results indicate that this bouncing scenario is feasible within the Rastall-like gravity framework, supported by particle production processes and stability conditions. The violation of energy conditions near the bounce point further confirms the consistency of this alternative cosmological model. The present work is focused on the theoretical foundations and internal consistency of the model; possible observational implications will be addressed in future investigations.

Traditionally, parameters such as the cosmological constant or the coefficients of higher-derivative terms are regarded as immutable features of the theory and therefore excluded from the thermodynamic phase space. In our recent work, we developed a fully general framework that promotes every such coupling to a dynamical, freely varying parameter of black hole solutions. This is accomplished by introducing, for each coupling, an auxiliary scalar and gauge field, through which the coupling appears as a conserved charge associated with the global sector of an emergent gauge symmetry. The corresponding conjugate variables naturally arise as electric potentials evaluated at the black hole horizon. As a result, the first law and the Smarr relation acquire additional, systematically determined contributions, yielding a consistent and universal extension of black hole thermodynamics. We illustrate the validity of this construction by revisiting several black hole examples in the literature where the Smarr formula remains inconsistent even after treating the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic variable. Our analysis shows that only by including all dimensionful couplings in this generalized manner can one obtain an internally consistent Smarr relation, thereby providing the foundation for a truly universal formulation of black hole thermodynamics."}

I. Abundance gradients through NLTE spectral analysis", "comment": "Manuscript submitted to A&A. Abstract shortened. Comments are welcome", "summary": "Classical Cepheids (CCs) have long been considered excellent tracers of the chemical evolution of the Milky Way's young disk. We present a homogeneous, NLTE spectroscopic analysis of 401 Galactic CCs, based on 1,351 high-resolution optical spectra, spanning Galactocentric distances from 4.6 to 29.3 kpc. Using PySME with MARCS atmospheres and state-of-the-art grids of NLTE departure coefficients, we derive atmospheric parameters and abundances for key species tracing multiple nucleosynthetic channels. Our sample-the largest CC NLTE dataset to date-achieves high internal precision and enables robust modeling of present-day thin-disk abundance patterns and radial gradients. We estimate abundance gradients using three analytic prescriptions (linear, logarithmic, bilinear with a break) within a Bayesian, outlier-robust framework, and we also apply Gaussian Process Regression to capture non-parametric variations. We find that NLTE atmospheric parameters differ systematically from LTE determinations. Moreover, iron and most elemental abundance profiles are better described by non-linear behavior rather than by single-slope linear models: logarithmic fits generally outperform simple linear models, while bilinear fits yield inconsistent break radii across elements. Gaussian Process models reveal a consistent outer-disk flattening of [X/H] for nearly all studied elements. The [X/Fe] ratios are largely flat with Galactocentric radius, indicating coherent chemical scaling with iron across the thin disk, with modest positive offsets for Na and Al and mild declines for Mn and Cu. Comparison with recent literature shows overall agreement but highlights NLTE-driven differences, especially in outer-disk abundances. These results provide tighter empirical constraints for chemo-dynamical models of the Milky Way and set the stage for future NLTE mapping with upcoming large spectroscopic surveys."}

Accepted for publication in Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences - Astrochemistry", "summary": "Sulfur-bearing molecules are central to interstellar chemistry, yet their observed abundances in the gas phase remain far below cosmic expectations in dense interstellar regions. Mixed N-S-O species such as thionylimide (HNSO) are particularly relevant, as they incorporate three key biogenic elements. The $cis$ conformer of HNSO has recently been detected in the Galactic Center cloud G+0.693-0.027, but no high-resolution data for the higher energy conformer ($trans$-HNSO) had been available until now. We report the first laboratory detection and rotational spectroscopic characterization of $trans$-HNSO. Spectra were recorded with the Center for Astrochemical Studies Absorption Cell (CASAC) free-space spectrometer employing a hollow-cathode discharge source, yielding 104 assigned transitions between 200 and 530 GHz. A Watson S-reduced Hamiltonian fit reproduced the data with an rms of 40 kHz, providing accurate rotational and centrifugal distortion constants in excellent agreement with CCSD(T) predictions. Although $trans$-HNSO lies only a few kcal/mol above the $cis$ form, it has larger dipole components, making its lines particularly intense (more than 5 times brighter, assuming equal abundances) and a very promising candidate for future astronomical detection. The new measurements enable reliable frequency predictions for astronomical searches and will be added to public databases. Combined with recent evidence for tunneling-driven $trans$-to-$cis$ isomerization at cryogenic temperatures, these results open the way to test directly whether quantum tunneling governs the interstellar distribution of HNSO isomers."}

We derive the effective scalar potential governing wave dynamics, which when viewed in the tortoise coordinate, exhibits two extremely sharp and widely separated barriers. These barriers form a resonant cavity and are a direct consequence of the near-horizon geometry of the wormhole mouths. Using time-domain integration, we analyze the wormhole's response to an initial scalar wave packet inside the throat. We find that the late-time signal contains a distinct train of echoes whose amplitude depends on the angular momentum number $l$. We show that higher $l$ modes produce significantly stronger echoes, as the corresponding potential barriers are taller and more reflective, which results in more efficient trapping of the wave within the wormhole throat."}

We test our method on 400 E and B polarization simulations based on the LiteBIRD experiment, containing the two main sources of contamination for CMB polarization experiments: polarized dust and synchrotron emission. We show that the bispectrum does not improve the precision of the power spectrum estimation or of the spectral parameters.

They also provide key insights into some qualitative aspects of the problem. In spite of this, there remain blind spots that hinder the understanding of the mechanisms underlying some observed phenomena, in particular concerning simplicity and universality in BH spacetimes. Adopting an 'asymptotic reasoning' approach, by filtering non-essential degrees of freedom, can potentially unveil universality patterns by identifying key underlying structural stability mechanisms. We first illustrate such an asymptotic approach by focusing on a BH quasinormal (QNM) Weyl's law, that accounts for the universal asymptotics of the QNM \"counting function\". This permits to identify light-trapping and the (local) redshift effect as the underlying mechanisms, also offering a bridge to the universal patterns found in BH QNM spectral instability. As a by-product, Weyl's law universality formally opens an observational access to spacetime (effective) dimensionality. More heuristically, we sketch a program recently put forward to apply such 'asymptotic reasoning' to address the observed simplicity and universality patterns in binary BH merger dynamics. This program is built as a hierarchy of asymptotic models, potentially making contact with integrability theory in gravity, namely through the background sector in a \"wave-mean flow\" approach to BH binary dynamics."}

We measure the position angles, ellipticities, and locations/centroids of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), the Intracluster Light (ICL), the hot Intracluster Medium (ICM), and the Core Lensing Mass (CLM) for a sample of strong lensing galaxy clusters from the Sloan Giant Arcs Survey (SGAS).

Additionally, we incorporate ICM morphological measures to classify the dynamical state of the cluster sample. Using this multi-component approach, we constrain the shape and centroids of these distributions in this sample and evaluate the different observable components in terms of their ability to trace the gravitational potential of their respective clusters. We find that misalignments between cluster components can be explained by astrophysical processes related to cluster assembly, relaxation, and merger histories. We find that the ICL is most closely aligned with its host DM halo, as traced by the CLM distribution, in both position angle and centroid.

In addition to the supermassive black hole Sgr A*, the inner parsec of our Galactic center is home to numerous fruitful scientific habitats. One of these environments is the S cluster, which consists of two distinct populations: the main-sequence S stars and the dusty G objects. While the majority of the brightest S stars can be classified as young B stars, the G sources can be described as dusty objects whose nature is still under debate. Aims. In this work, we focus on the most prominent G objects in the S cluster and follow their Keplerian trajectory around Sgr A*. With this, we test the predictions based on almost two decades of monitoring of the direct vicinity of our central supermassive black hole using NACO and SINFONI, formerly mounted at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The goal is to increase the existing data baseline for G2/DSO, D9, and X7 to get insights into their evolution on their Keplerian trajectories. In addition, we revisit the massive Young Stellar Object (YSO) X3 and scrutinize the potential impact of its environment on this highly dynamic source. Methods. The successor to the two instruments is called ERIS and offers upgraded optics and improved properties, including an enhanced spectral resolution. We utilize the IFU mode of ERIS, called SPIFFIER. We search for the Doppler-shifted Brγ emission line to rediscover peculiar objects in the S cluster using SPIFFIER with the highest available spatial plate scale of 12.5 mas. Furthermore, we will derive the Brγ luminosity of G2/DSO to inspect the degree of its change more than ten years after the pericenter passage. If present, a decrease in the Brγ luminosity of G2/DSO on its descending part of the orbit would directly impact the direction of the debate about its nature."}

Cross-correlating these surveys can constrain the redshift distribution of radio sources, mitigate systematic effects, and place constraints on cosmological models. We perform the first measurement of the clustering cross-spectrum between radio-continuum sources in the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey and galaxies from the ESA Euclid satellite mission's Q1 release. Our goal is to detect and characterise the cross-correlation signal, test its robustness against systematic effects, and compare our measurements with theoretical predictions. We use data from the Australian SKA Pathfinder's EMU Main Survey, which overlaps with the Euclid Deep Field South. We generate two radio-source catalogues using different source finders to create galaxy maps. We measure the harmonic-space cross-correlation signal using a pseudo-spectrum estimator. The measured signal is compared to theoretical predictions based on a ΛCDM cosmology, using several models for the EMU source redshift distribution and bias. We report detection above 8σ of the cross-correlation signal consistent across all tested models and data sets. The measured cross-spectra from the two radio catalogues are in excellent agreement, demonstrating that the cross-correlation is robust against the choice of source-finding algorithm. The measured signal also agrees with theoretical models developed from previous cross-correlation studies and simulations. This pathfinder study establishes a statistically significant cross-correlation between EMU and Euclid. The robustness of the signal is a crucial validation of the methodology, paving the way for future large-scale analyses leveraging the full power of this synergy to constrain cosmological parameters and our understanding of galaxy evolution."}

However, realistic experimental setups render the associated Bogoliubov integrals analytically intractable. To address this challenge, we introduce the Inertial Replacement Method (IRM), a hybrid analytic-numerical framework for computing Bogoliubov coefficients for general moving-mirror trajectories. The IRM replaces the asymptotically inertial portions of a trajectory with analytic inertial extensions, so that numerical evaluation is required only for the finite accelerating segment. We derive perturbative error bounds for both perfectly and imperfectly reflecting mirrors, providing controlled accuracy estimates and guiding the choice of segmentation thresholds. The method is validated against analytically solvable trajectories and then applied to a fully numerical, PIC-based Chen-Mourou plasma-mirror trajectory relevant to the planned AnaBHEL experiment. A key physical insight emerging from this analysis is that the radiation spectrum is determined almost entirely by the finite accelerating region, with negligible sensitivity to the far-past and far-future inertial motion. These results establish the IRM as a reliable and broadly applicable computational tool for modeling particle creation in realistic analog-gravity systems such as AnaBHEL."}

The FLI network extracts rich non-Gaussian information from the shear field to produce informative features, which are then used by SBI to model the resulting complex posteriors. To mitigate noise from intrinsic galaxy shapes, we develop a blind, training-free, PCA-based shear denoising method. Tests on CSST-like mock catalogs reveal significant performance gains. The shear-based inference achieves approximately twice the cosmological constraining power in Figure of Merit (FoM) compared to the conventional convergence-based approach. Moreover, the combination of PCA denoising and ML compression can deliver a 36.4% improvement in FoM over standard shear two-point statistics. This work establishes a scalable and robust pathway for cosmological inference, unlocking the full potential of Stage-IV weak-lensing surveys."}

We apply the data-driven approach proposed by Posti (2022) to include the characteristic amplitude and scale length of such correlations as `nuisance parameters'. We construct mass models for $134$ galaxies from the SPARC rotation curve compilation with Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and pseudo-isothermal sphere (pISO) models for the dark halo. Allowing for correlations in the rotation curves generally improves the goodness of fit for both halo models, often yielding a formally good fit ($χ^2_\\mathrm{r}\\approx 1$) and model uncertainties that seem more representative of the constraining power of the data. For both halo models the inference on the typical correlation amplitude and scale length are very similar and physically plausible, $\\sim 20\\,\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $\\sim 5\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$, respectively. The parametric form that we use to describe the correlations is intentionally simple, and our fitting approach makes the parameters describing possible correlations prone to `absorbing' other systematic errors, so we regard these estimates as upper limits. Without allowing for correlations we find a statistical preference for the pISO over the NFW model for $88$/$134$ galaxies; this preference essentially disappears when correlations are allowed for. Accounting for correlations in rotation curves when constructing mass models fundamentally affects how they are interpreted, highlighting an important systematic uncertainty that affects evidence for cusps or cores in dark matter haloes."}

To bridge this crucial gap, this work presents the first systematic analysis of strong-field, wave-optical GW lensing by a Kerr black hole (BH), extending recent results for non-rotating lenses obtained in Chan et al. to the astrophysically more relevant case of spinning lens. Using the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi formalism, we compute the strong-field scattering factor (SFSF) and show that the the spin produces characteristic modifications to the lensed waveform, and high-frequency incident radiation is not strongly absorbed by the BH lens, contrary to earlier claims in Chan et al. We further derive an explicit expression for the observed waveform for the general source-lens-observer configuration, showcasing the distortions produced by the scattering and quantifying their departure from the Schwarzschild case. Specializing to on-axis scattering, a mismatch analysis for a \\texttt{GW150914}-like source lensed by a Kerr BH of mass $M=10^2M_\\odot$ situated $100GM/c^2$ away from the source reveals percentage-level deviations from the direct (unscattered) wave at scattering angles near $30^\\circ$, across a range of lens spin values. The mismatch exhibits a sharp decrease at larger scattering angles. For a fixed scattering angle, however, the mismatch shows only a weak dependence on the BH spin in the case of on-axis scattering, which may improve for more general off-axis considerations. The framework developed here offers a unified treatment of strong-field GW scattering in Kerr spacetime and provides tools for interpreting future high-precision observations of compact-object lenses in the wave-optics regime."}

We present the first systematic observations of SO and $^{34}$SO toward a large sample of molecular clouds with accurate distances, performed with the IRAM 30 m and the 10 m Submillimeter Telescope (SMT).

No correlation was found between the SO/$^{34}$SO ratio and heliocentric distance or $T_k$, suggesting negligible distance and fractionation effects. Both LTE and non-LTE analyses consistently suggest that the optical depth effect is also insignificant. $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S ratios from the $2_2-1_1$ transitions follow the increasing radial trend proposed by previous CS species measurements, while those from the $5_5-4_4$ lines are systematically lower. The lower transitions of SO and $^{34}$SO may be suitable tracers of $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S, though the detections are rare.

Within a thin-disk accretion model and the ZAMO framework, we numerically solve the geodesics equation of photon and simulate the corresponding thin-disk images and polarization patterns. The results show that the LV parameter l strongly affects the inner shadow, brightness asymmetry, and polarization properties of the thin disk. The decrease of l leads to a more elliptical and untilted inner shadow, while increasing l produces a pronounced leftward D-shaped structure of the critical curve. In addition, the variation of l alters the distribution of polarized intensity and polarization direction, especially near the critical curve. Moreover, it also shows that a positive l enhances the black hole's angular velocity, while a negative one suppresses it, indicating that the sign of l determines the trend direction of the LV effect. These findings suggest that future high-resolution EHT observations combining the thin-disk images and polarization patterns could provide valuable tests of the LV effect."}

We find that, at the same mass scale, halos that form under the fractional potential are much more dense than those that from the Newtonian potential.

We performed high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of massive galaxies at high redshift ($z\\sim10$) in rare density peaks, incorporating various chemical evolution channels including stellar winds, core-collapse, Type Ia supernovae, and asymptotic giant branch stars. Our simulations reproduce several key features of high-redshift galaxies: (1) stars form with high efficiencies ($>0.1$) at the center of rare peak halos, creating very compact galaxies similar to GN-z11; (2) high N/O ratios emerge during the first 10-20 Myr of intense starburst, before being diluted by CCSNe; (3) multiple star clusters form in and around the galaxy with high efficiency ($\\sim20\\%$), some of which exhibit high N/O ratios and sodium-oxygen anti-correlations similar to those observed in local globular clusters.

The global structure of some regular black holes, e.g. Hayward black hole, features an event horizon and a Cauchy horizon, raising fundamental questions about the latter's stability. In this work, we investigate collapse of a scalar field in Hayward spacetime. Under weak scalar perturbations, the inner horizon maintains a stable finite radius. In the circumstance of a strong scalar field, the inner horizon shrinks to zero volume, accompanied by the formation of a spacelike singularity. The Hayward geometry is effectively converted into a Schwarzschild-like geometry. Furthermore, the strength of the scalar field governs the contraction dynamics of the inner horizon. As the parameter $p$ of the initial profile for the scalar field approaches the critical threshold ${p_*}$, the radius of the inner horizon ${r_{-}}$ exhibits a universal scaling behavior: ${r_{-}}\\propto{|p - {p_*}|^γ}$, with a critical exponent $γ\\approx 0.5$."}

Accepted for publication in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A", "summary": "Dark matter haloes are typically characterised by radial density profiles with fixed forms motivated by simulations (e.g. NFW). However, simulation predictions depend on uncertain dark matter physics and baryonic modelling. Here, we present a method to constrain halo density profiles directly from observations using Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR), a technique that searches the space of analytic expressions for the function that best balances accuracy and simplicity for a given dataset. We test the approach on mock weak lensing excess surface density (ESD) data of synthetic clusters with NFW profiles. Motivated by real data, we assign each ESD data point a constant fractional uncertainty and vary this uncertainty and the number of clusters to probe how data precision and sample size affect model selection. For fractional errors around 5%, ESR recovers the NFW profile even from samples as small as 20 clusters. At higher uncertainties representative of current surveys, simpler functions are favoured over NFW, though it remains competitive. This preference arises because weak lensing errors are smallest in the outskirts, causing the fits to be dominated by the outer profile. ESR therefore provides a robust, simulation-independent framework both for testing mass models and determining which features of a halo's density profile are genuinely constrained by the data."}

We have used a sample of K giant and RRLyrae stars based on Gaia DR3 data and two different set of simulations, to test the new formalism. From our analysis, we found that the inclusion of a nonhomogeneous background improves substantially the estimation of the subhalo dark matter mass. The methodology is not sufficiently sensitive to discriminate between different density distribution functions for the perturber, however, in the case of the observational data, the inclussion of the cloud's circular velocity is a fundamental tool to complement the analysis. The results obtained including the host halo potential agree with the independent previous measurements or with the reported value for the subhalo dark matter mass in the simulations. These results show that it is possible to measure the mass of smaller subhalos through their gravitational wake, even for subhalos closer to their host, with distances lower than 30 kpc."}

In particular, we show that for non-spherically symmetric solutions arising from compactly supported initial data, the late-time decay deviates from Price's law -- governing the decay for stationary black hole backgrounds -- by exhibiting slower time decay by exactly one additional power.\n  Our proof is based around the observation that the emergence of late-time \"tails\", featuring inverse-polynomial decay in time, is intimately connected to conformal irregularity properties in space (towards future null infinity) of time integrals of the solutions. This relationship is exploited through a purely physical-space approach based around energy estimates, in which the dynamical wave operator is treated as a Schwarzschild wave operator with an inhomogeneous term. Going from almost-sharp decay to global asymptotics is achieved by exploiting this relation for the difference between the solution and a carefully chosen global tail function.\n  We further apply our method to several examples of nonlinear wave equations and comment on its robustness to more general settings, such as dynamical spacetimes converging to sub-extremal Kerr spacetimes and higher-dimensional wave operators with even or odd spacetime dimensions."}

Two of its remarkable features are (i) inflation can be realized even by very steep potentials and (ii) such a scenario doesn't call for a separate post-inflation reheating phase. We exploit the first feature to show that Warm Inflation can successfully take place on the very steep left wing of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential while remaining in excellent agreement with current cosmological data (joint analysis of Planck, ACT and DESI). The Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential has a flatter right wing as well, which opens up the possibility of dark energy when the field rolls along this wing. However in order to successfully realize quintessential inflation one needs to (i) normalize the two wings of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential differently in order to bridge between the two extreme energy scales of inflation and dark energy, (ii) allow the quintessence field to be dissipative, which is consistent with the presence of a dissipative term in warm inflation. The dissipative dynamics of the quintessence field is needed in order to sustain slow-roll in the right wing. With these modifications, we demonstrate that the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential can give rise to a unified model of warm inflation (on the left wing) and transient dark energy (on the right wing)."}

We model PVF and HVF velocity distributions using Gaussian Mixture Models, compare Si II and Ca II PVF velocity distributions, assess Ca II HVF properties, and test correlations between Si II PVF velocities and $Δm_{15}$, with emphasis on HVF effects. For the first time, we show that the Ca II PVF velocity distribution, measured for the same events at the same phases as Si II, is predominantly unimodal, in contrast to the well-known bimodal Si II PVF distribution that supports the high-velocity/normal-velocity division. This contrast likely reflects a subclass-dependent formation depth of the Ca II line, as supported by a positive correlation ($>3.3σ$) between $Δm_{15}$ and the velocity offset between Ca II and Si II PVFs, particularly in faster-declining SNe Ia. Importantly, HVFs do not significantly bias PVF velocity distributions. A significant negative correlation ($>3.3σ$) between Si II PVF velocity and $Δm_{15}$ is found only for HVF-weak SNe Ia, consistent with more energetic explosions yielding faster ejecta, while this trend vanishes in HVF-strong events, likely due to circumstellar interaction.

In the continuum limit, we show that the Entanglement Distance arising from displacement transformations is proportional to the total number of excitations in the quantum state for cubic perturbations, thus providing an upper bound on the von Neumann entanglement entropy of any reduced state compatible with such excitations.

An estimate of the best-fit mass-averaged optical depth is obtained by comparing the pairwise kSZ curve with the linear-theory prediction of the pairwise velocity under the best-fit Planck cosmology, and is compared with predictions from simulations. This estimate serves as a reference point for future comparisons with thermal SZ-derived optical depth measurements for the same DESI cluster samples, which will be presented in a companion paper. Finally, we employ a machine-learning approach trained on simulations to estimate the optical depth for 456,803 DESI LRG-identified clusters within the simulated mass range (greater than about 1e13 solar masses). These are combined with the measured kSZ signal to infer the individual cluster peculiar velocities, providing the opportunity to constrain the behavior of gravity and the dark sector over a range of cosmic scales and epochs."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "While mergers between massive galaxies and their dwarf satellites are well studied, the properties of dwarf-dwarf satellite mergers are not well constrained. Stellar streams trace satellite disruption and, in the dwarf galaxy regime, are predicted to provide novel constraints on low-mass galaxy evolution and dark matter. However, the mass ratios required to form these streams make them challenging to detect. We present a preview of the Stellar Stream Legacy Survey (SSLS) in the dwarf galaxy regime. The SSLS aims to produce a statistically large, homogeneous sample of stellar streams, in order to yield new constraints on galaxy formation through comparison with theory. We visually inspect dwarf galaxies using the Legacy Imaging Survey (and DECaLS footprints, r-band 29 mag arcsec-2) within 4-35 Mpc. We develop a classification metric to categorise accretion debris around dwarf galaxies, and measure the frequency of accretion features in the footprint. We present the first release of accretion features around dwarf galaxies, including 1 stream, 11 shells, and 8 asymmetric stellar halos, of which 17 constitute new identifications. We find that less than 5.07 percent of dwarfs (37/730) contain detectable accretion features, which is lower than the SSLS results for massive galaxies, and discuss a tentative shell detection bias. Our results highlight the difficulty of detecting streams around dwarf galaxies, and identify the need for improved theoretical modelling of low-mass merger morphologies. Nevertheless, they place observational constraints on hierarchical mass assembly in this regime."}

The neutrino mass is modeled as a power-law, exponential, or hybrid function of the scalar field, yielding an effective potential that includes neutrino backreaction. Starting from the Einstein-Hilbert action in a flat FLRW background, we derive the modified Friedmann and Klein Gordon equations incorporating this coupling. Using the Fermi-Dirac integrals, we account for the continuous transition of neutrinos from relativistic to non-relativistic regimes. The inflationary dynamics are analyzed via the slow roll parameters derived from the effective potential. Our results show that the scalar neutrino coupling alters the potential slope and curvature, thereby influencing the duration of inflation. The hybrid coupling form provides the most flexible realization, unifying neutrino mass generation with early universe inflation within a single scalar field framework."}

Our FAST observed targets are combined with other AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies covered in the ALFALFA footprint to form a more comprehensive sample. Utilizing the information from optical surveys, we further divide them into isolated and accompanied subsamples by their vicinity of nearby massive galaxies. We compare the Hi gas abundance and star-forming rate (SFR) between the subsamples to assess the role of internal and external processes that may regulate the gas content in dwarf galaxies. As a result, we find that AGN are more commonly identified in accompanied dwarf galaxies than in their isolated counterparts. Meanwhile, AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies have slightly but significant lower Hi mass fraction relatively to the non-AGN control sample in accompanied dwarf galaxies. On the other hand, we find a decreasing SFR in AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies towards denser environments, as well as an extremely low incidence of quenched isolated dwarfs within both AGN and non-AGN subsamples. These results indicate that although these AGN could potentially regulate the gas reservoir of dwarf galaxies, environmental effects are likely the dominant quenching mechanism in the low-mass universe."}

We start using the present-day photon density as an anchor, and use the baryon-to-photon ratio from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis based measurements and the baryon-to-matter ratio from the baryons' imprint on galaxy clustering to translate to a physical matter density at present day. We then compare this to measurements of the ratio of the matter density to the critical density ($Ω_{\\mathrm{m}}$), calculated using the relative positions of the baryon acoustic oscillations, to measure the critical density of the universe and hence $H_0$. The important measurements of the evolution of the energy density all happen at low redshift, so we consider this a low-redshift measurement. We validate our method both on a suite of $N$-body mocks and on noiseless theory vectors generated across a wide range of Hubble parameters in both $Λ$CDM and EDE cosmologies. Using DESI DR1 data combined with the angular CMB acoustic scale and the latest BBN constraints, we find $H_0 = 69.0 \\pm 2.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, consistent with existing early and late-time determinations of the Hubble constant.

Traditional methods for identifying bars are often labor-intensive and subjective, limiting their scalability for large astronomical surveys. To address this, a synthetic dataset of 1,000 barred spiral galaxy images was generated, incorporating realistic components such as disks, bars, bulges, spiral arms, stars, and observational noise, modeled through Gaussian, Ferrers, and Sersic functions. The YOLO-OBB model, trained on this dataset for six epochs, achieved robust validation metrics, including a precision of 0.93745, recall of 0.85, and mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 0.94173. Applied to 10 real galaxy images, the model extracted physical parameters, such as bar lengths ranging from 2.27 to 9.70 kpc and orientations from 13.41$^\\circ$ to 134.11$^\\circ$, with detection confidences between 0.26 and 0.68. These measurements, validated through pixel-to-kiloparsec conversions, align with established bar sizes, demonstrating the model's reliability. The methodology's scalability and interpretability enable efficient analysis of complex galaxy morphologies, particularly for dwarf galaxies and varied orientations. Future research aims to expand the dataset to 5,000 galaxies and integrate the Tremaine-Weinberg method to measure bar pattern speeds, enhancing insights into galaxy dynamics and evolution.

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of six representative DDE parametrization models by utilizing the latest and most precise CMB data jointly from ACT, SPT, and Planck, in conjunction with BAO data from DESI DR2 and SN data from DESY5, PantheonPlus, and Union3. Our overall analysis indicates that the preference for DDE in the Quintom-B regime remains robust, regardless of the DDE parameterization model and the data combination employed. The trend of this preference is significantly strengthened with the support of DESY5 SN data. Specifically, when using the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, for the Barboza-Alcaniz (BA) model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.785 \\pm 0.047$ and $w_a = -0.43^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, which significantly deviate from the $Λ$CDM values and provide evidence for DDE at the $4.2σ$ level. By the reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$, normalized dark energy density $f_{\\mathrm{DE}}(z)$, and the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, we also observe clear departures from $Λ$CDM, further reinforcing the case for DDE. Furthermore, the Bayesian evidence analysis indicates that the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder, BA and Exponential models are moderately favored relative to $Λ$CDM based on the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data."}

This produces a different pre-recombination distribution of baryons and dark matter. After recombination, the gravitational potential responds to both components in proportion to their mass, allowing robust measurement of the baryon fraction. This is independent of new-physics scenarios altering the recombination background (e.g. Early Dark Energy). The accuracy of such measurements does, however, depend on how baryons and CDM are modeled in the power spectrum. Previous template-based splitting relied on approximate transfer functions that neglected part of information. We present a new method that embeds an extra parameter controlling the balance between baryons and dark matter in the growth terms of the perturbation equations in the CAMB Boltzmann solver. This approach captures the baryonic suppression of CDM prior to recombination, avoids inconsistencies, and yields a clean parametrization of the baryon fraction in the linear power spectrum, separating out the simple physics of growth due to the combined matter potential. We implement this framework in an analysis pipeline using Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure with HOD-informed priors and validate it against noiseless LCDM and EDE cosmologies with DESI-like errors. The new scheme achieves comparable precision to previous splitting while reducing systematic biases, providing a more robust way to baryon-fraction measurements. In combination with BBN constraints on the baryon density and Alcock-Paczynski estimates of the matter density, these results strengthen the use of baryon fraction measurements to derive a Hubble constant from energy densities, with future DESI and Euclid data expected to deliver competitive constraints."}

Here, we apply our method to VVVX data covering low-latitude regions of the Galactic bulge and disk, affected by extinction and crowding.\n  Methods: We introduce the Consensus-based Algorithm for Nonparametric Detection of Star Clusters (CANDiSC), which integrates kernel density estimation, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), and nearest-neighbour density estimation within a consensus framework. A stellar overdensity is classified as a candidate if identified by at least two of these methods. We apply CANDiSC to 680 tiles in the VVVX PSF photometric catalogue, covering approximately 1100 square degrees.\n  Results: We detect 163 stellar overdensities, of which 118 are known clusters. Cross-matching with recent catalogues yields five additional matches, leaving 40 likely new candidates absent from existing compilations.

Furthermore, the data suggest that the equation of state may have been in the phantom regime in the distant past, recently undergoing a phantom crossing. In this work, we investigate whether this preference can be realized within a kinetically mixed axion-dilaton (KMIX) quintessence model, a string-motivated system in which an axion-like field couples exponentially to a dilaton-like (moduli) field. Crucially, KMIX can appear phantom in a standard Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) based analysis. To confront the model with data, we develop a fast pipeline based on normalizing flows that (i) learns a theory-informed prior on $(w_0,w_a)$ from KMIX realizations and (ii) provides an inverse mapping from CPL parameters back to the physical KMIX parameters. By importance-sampling pre-computed CPL chains using this framework, we effectively transform generic phenomenological constraints into direct, computationally efficient constraints on the underlying KMIX theory, avoiding the prohibitive cost of full parameter space exploration. Applied to Planck+DESI DR2 BAO measurements, our framework finds support for KMIX at $2.5σ$ compared to the base CPL fit at $3.1σ$, demonstrating that KMIX may account for the DESI preference without invoking true phantom behavior. When additionally including Type Ia supernovae data, we find that the preference remains above $3σ$ for Union3 and DES Y5, but drops to $2.1σ$ with Pantheon+. The latter, combined with the DESI full-shape power spectrum and bispectrum data, further reduces the preference to $1.7σ$. Ultimately, should the DESI deviation persist with future data, KMIX may offer a theoretically well-motivated explanation for the phantom-like signatures inferred from phenomenological fits."}

Using five Milky Way-mass halos from the Aquarius simulations, we introduce an information-theoretic framework to quantify spatial-chemical correlations through the mutual information (MI) between angular position and metallicity. We divide stars in each halo into high- and low-metallicity populations based on their median metallicity and examine their metallicity distribution functions (MDFs), spatial anisotropies, and angular-metallicity couplings as a function of galactocentric radius. The MDFs exhibit remarkable diversity, ranging from single-peaked distributions dominated by one or two massive progenitors to broad or bimodal forms shaped by multiple accretion events, revealing the stochastic nature of halo assembly. The low-metallicity stars, primarily contributed by disrupted satellites, display higher spatial anisotropy and stronger angular clustering than their metal-rich counterparts. After removing bound satellites, anisotropy decreases significantly, yet high-metallicity stars remain marginally more anisotropic, reflecting the lingering debris of massive, centrally deposited progenitors. The mutual information between angular position and metallicity increases with radius before saturating in the outskirts, with the difference between the data and randomized controls confined mainly to the inner halo signifying residual spatial-chemical coupling driven by incomplete phase mixing. Our results demonstrate that information-theoretic diagnostics provide a powerful and intuitive way to quantify the chemical complexity of stellar halos and offer a promising route to compare simulations with forthcoming high-dimensional Galactic survey data."}

Two of its remarkable features are (i) inflation can be realized even by very steep potentials and (ii) such a scenario doesn't call for a separate post-inflation reheating phase. We exploit the first feature to show that Warm Inflation can successfully take place on the very steep left wing of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential while remaining in excellent agreement with current cosmological data (joint analysis of Planck, ACT and DESI). The Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential has a flatter right wing as well, which opens up the possibility of dark energy when the field rolls along this wing. However in order to successfully realize quintessential inflation one needs to (i) normalize the two wings of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential differently in order to bridge between the two extreme energy scales of inflation and dark energy, (ii) allow the quintessence field to be dissipative, which is consistent with the presence of a dissipative term in warm inflation. The dissipative dynamics of the quintessence field is needed in order to sustain slow-roll in the right wing. With these modifications, we demonstrate that the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential can give rise to a unified model of warm inflation (on the left wing) and transient dark energy (on the right wing)."}

We find that the alignment amplitude depends significantly on cosmological and supernova feedback parameters - specifically $Ω_m$, $σ_8$, $A_{\\text{SN1}}$, $A_{\\text{SN2}}$- while no dependence on AGN feedback is observed (due to the limited simulation volume $(25\\,h^{-1}\\,\\text{Mpc})^3$). The dependence on $σ_8$ vanishes when projected correlation functions $w_{m+}$ are normalized by matter density correlations $w_{mm}$, consistent with predictions from linear alignment models. We find alignment amplitudes in quiescent galaxies to exceed those in star-forming galaxies by an order of magnitude. Moreover, examining orientation-only correlation functions from ellipticity-normalized galaxies $\\tilde w_{m+}$, we confirm that alignment signals retain sensitivity to supernova feedback across full, star forming, quiescent, and ellipticity-normalized samples. Finally, we find evidence that supernova feedback impacts alignment signals differently in star-forming versus quiescent populations, suggesting that distinct alignment mechanisms operate across galaxy types. Our results offer key insights for understanding galaxy formation and alignment models for future weak gravitational lensing analyses."}

We explore two prescriptions for the high-redshift ($z>7$) Lyman-Werner background (LWB), differing in intensity and redshift evolution. Star formation begins early ($z\\gtrsim8$) in progenitors with $M_{\\mathrm{200c}}\\sim10^5$-$10^6 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, where molecular hydrogen enables warm moderate-density gas to efficiently cool. The LWB strongly influences the $z=0$ halo occupation fraction, shifting the dark-to-luminous transition from $M_{\\mathrm{200c}}\\sim10^7 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ (weaker LWB) to $M_{\\mathrm{200c}}\\sim10^8 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ (stronger LWB). Galaxies with $M_\\ast\\gtrsim10^5 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ are mostly insensitive to the LWB choice, whereas lower mass systems respond strongly, producing markedly different stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relations. The weaker LWB yields a very shallow SMHM slope with nearly constant scatter, while the stronger LWB introduces a pronounced break at $M_{\\mathrm{200c}}\\sim10^9 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, where haloes of similar mass host galaxies with $M_\\ast\\sim10^3$ to $10^5 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ or remain dark.

The advent of exascale computing now enables a new generation of simulations that couple these physical processes across full-sky volumes with excellent statistical sampling of large-scale structure tracers such as galaxies, groups, and clusters. To support these efforts, we extend the CRK-HACC framework, a GPU-accelerated cosmological hydrodynamics code, with a suite of astrophysical subgrid models that simulate radiative cooling, star formation, stellar evolution, and AGN feedback within a numerically robust formulation optimized for scalability on modern exascale architectures. The models were selected and calibrated to reproduce observed galaxy stellar mass functions over the redshift range $0 < z < 2$ and cluster populations probed by cosmological surveys, capturing the large-scale baryonic evolution relevant for multi-wavelength, cross-correlated analyses. We describe the implementation and calibration of these models and demonstrate their consistency with observed galaxy population statistics and modern hydrodynamic simulations, establishing the baseline for exascale efforts that extend this framework to survey-scale volumes."}

A key goal going forward is to understand the diversity of NS-NS merger remnants, and how such diversity maps onto their viability as gamma-ray burst (GRB) central engines. Here, we present a study aimed at assessing the sensitivity of triggered searches for intermediate-duration, post-merger GWs powered by long-lived GRB remnants using networks of current and future ground-based GW detectors and the Cross-Correlation Algorithm (CoCoA). We develop a Python-based framework to efficiently estimate CoCoA distance horizons for a broad range of post merger secular bar-mode waveforms and for different GW detector networks. This framework can be used to identify the most promising regions of parameter space in which to concentrate search efforts, helping design future search strategies to optimally balance search sensitivity and related parameter space gridding schema against computational cost."}

We report the first detailed analysis of the giant radio halo in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 2163, using upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) and Very Large Array (VLA) observations. Combining radio data (300-1400 MHz) with archival X-ray data offers a unique opportunity to study the complex ICM physics of the cluster. The sensitive uGMRT observations map the halo emission for the first time out to an extent of ~3.3 Mpc, up to $r_{500}$, and also effectively recover other diffuse sources. The radio surface brightness profile is well fitted with an exponential function up to r$_{500}$, with an evolution of e-folding radius over frequencies (larger at low frequencies). The spatially resolved spectral index map reveals fluctuations and outward radial steepening of the average spectral index. Radio and X-ray surface brightness are well correlated, with a correlation slope of $\\sim$0.70 for the halo, and $\\sim$0.40 for the ridge. The correlation slope varies from cluster centre to outskirts, suggesting the magnetic field and thermal gas density scaling relation (B $\\propto n_{e}^{0.5}$) should be reassessed, provided that the re-acceleration efficiency is constant. We propose that diffuse lobes at the periphery could serve as a reservoir for seed electrons, behind the radio halo emission, with an estimated acceleration efficiency reaching $\\sim$0.1% in the external regions. Additionally, a major E-W merger is suggested, leading to turbulence in the ICM and generating the halo."}

A lensing black hole at several lys away separates the polarized beams about $10^{12}$m apart. This splitting is larger than the radius of the Earth. Therefore, an observer on Earth would see different circularly polarized light according to their location. The polarization will change while the detector is wandering around.

We aim to understand the relationship between the power of AGN feedback and the cooling of gas in the centres of galaxy clusters by correlating the radio properties of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) with the X-ray properties of their host clusters. We used catalogues from the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) along with ASKAP radio data. In total, we identified 134 radio sources associated with BCGs of the 151 eRASS1 clusters located in the PS1, PS2, and SWAG-X ASKAP fields. Non-detections were treated as upper limits. We correlated BCG radio luminosity, largest linear size (LLS), and BCG offset with the integrated X-ray luminosity of their host clusters. To characterise cool cores (CCs) and non-cool cores (NCCs), we used the concentration parameter $c_{R_{500}}$ and combined it with the BCG offset to assess cluster dynamical state. We analysed the correlation between radio mechanical power and X-ray luminosity within the CC subsample. We observe a potential positive trend between LLS and BCG offset, suggesting an environmental effect on radio-source morphology. We find a weak trend where more luminous central radio galaxies are found in clusters with higher X-ray luminosity. Within the CC subsample, there is a positive but highly scattered relationship between the mechanical luminosity of AGN jets and the X-ray cooling luminosity. This finding is supported by bootstrap resampling and flux-flux analyses. The correlation indicates that AGN feedback is ineffective in high-luminosity (high-mass) clusters. At a cooling luminosity of $L_{\\mathrm{X},~r<R_\\mathrm{cool}}\\approx 5.50\\times10^{43}$ erg/s, on average, AGN feedback appears to contribute only about 13%-22% of the energy needed to offset the radiative losses in the ICM."}

In particular, we aim to include different density distribution functions for the perturber and a non homogeneous background due to the host's halo gravitational potential. We have used a sample of K giant and RRLyrae stars based on Gaia DR3 data and two different set of simulations, to test the new formalism. From our analysis, we found that the inclusion of a nonhomogeneous background improves substantially the estimation of the subhalo dark matter mass. The methodology is not sufficiently sensitive to discriminate between different density distribution functions for the perturber, however, in the case of the observational data, the inclussion of the cloud's circular velocity is a fundamental tool to complement the analysis. The results obtained including the host halo potential agree with the independent previous measurements or with the reported value for the subhalo dark matter mass in the simulations. These results show that it is possible to measure the mass of smaller subhalos through their gravitational wake, even for subhalos closer to their host, with distances lower than 30 kpc."}

Accepted for publication in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A", "summary": "Dark matter haloes are typically characterised by radial density profiles with fixed forms motivated by simulations (e.g. NFW). However, simulation predictions depend on uncertain dark matter physics and baryonic modelling. Here, we present a method to constrain halo density profiles directly from observations using Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR), a technique that searches the space of analytic expressions for the function that best balances accuracy and simplicity for a given dataset. We test the approach on mock weak lensing excess surface density (ESD) data of synthetic clusters with NFW profiles. Motivated by real data, we assign each ESD data point a constant fractional uncertainty and vary this uncertainty and the number of clusters to probe how data precision and sample size affect model selection. For fractional errors around 5%, ESR recovers the NFW profile even from samples as small as 20 clusters. At higher uncertainties representative of current surveys, simpler functions are favoured over NFW, though it remains competitive. This preference arises because weak lensing errors are smallest in the outskirts, causing the fits to be dominated by the outer profile. ESR therefore provides a robust, simulation-independent framework both for testing mass models and determining which features of a halo's density profile are genuinely constrained by the data."}

In particular, we quantify entanglement generation via the recently proposed Entanglement Distance, which introduces a geometric interpretation of quantum correlations in terms of the Fubini-Study metric. In the continuum limit, we show that the Entanglement Distance arising from displacement transformations is proportional to the total number of excitations in the quantum state for cubic perturbations, thus providing an upper bound on the von Neumann entanglement entropy of any reduced state compatible with such excitations. Within the interaction picture, we further observe that the quantum correlations arising from cubic gravitational interactions are typically much larger than the standard squeezing contribution, in agreement with previous studies focusing on von Neumann entropy generation across the Hubble horizon. We further show how the inflationary parameters affect the total amount of such correlations, highlighting in particular their dependence on the inflationary energy scales and the number of e-foldings during slow-roll."}

Using five Milky Way-mass halos from the Aquarius simulations, we introduce an information-theoretic framework to quantify spatial-chemical correlations through the mutual information (MI) between angular position and metallicity. We divide stars in each halo into high- and low-metallicity populations based on their median metallicity and examine their metallicity distribution functions (MDFs), spatial anisotropies, and angular-metallicity couplings as a function of galactocentric radius. The MDFs exhibit remarkable diversity, ranging from single-peaked distributions dominated by one or two massive progenitors to broad or bimodal forms shaped by multiple accretion events, revealing the stochastic nature of halo assembly. The low-metallicity stars, primarily contributed by disrupted satellites, display higher spatial anisotropy and stronger angular clustering than their metal-rich counterparts. After removing bound satellites, anisotropy decreases significantly, yet high-metallicity stars remain marginally more anisotropic, reflecting the lingering debris of massive, centrally deposited progenitors. The mutual information between angular position and metallicity increases with radius before saturating in the outskirts, with the difference between the data and randomized controls confined mainly to the inner halo signifying residual spatial-chemical coupling driven by incomplete phase mixing. Our results demonstrate that information-theoretic diagnostics provide a powerful and intuitive way to quantify the chemical complexity of stellar halos and offer a promising route to compare simulations with forthcoming high-dimensional Galactic survey data."}
