Inefficient intermediate-mass black hole seeding via stellar collisions in young massive clusters", "comment": "14 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables. Comments welcome", "summary": "Young massive clusters (YMCs) provide favorable environments for frequent stellar collisions, potentially leading to the formation of very massive stars (VMSs) and seeds of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We investigate the role of repeated stellar collisions in YMCs using TITANS, a new suite of 18 direct $N$-body simulations. Our models span cluster masses $10^5 - 10^6\\,\\rm M_\\odot$, half-mass densities $ρ_{\\rm h}=100 - 10^5\\,\\rm M_\\odot\\,pc^{-3}$, and include high primordial binary fractions, consistent with observations of massive stars in young clusters. Overall, our simulations assume cluster properties that are typical of YMCs in the low-redshift Universe. We find that repeated stellar collisions are efficient only in the densest clusters with short relaxation times and are absent in systems with $ρ_{\\rm h}<500\\,\\rm M_\\odot\\,pc^{-3}$ and $t_{\\rm rh}>1.3\\,\\rm Gyr$. Rapid mass segregation allows massive stars to sink to the cluster center, merge, and undergo subsequent collisions, even in clusters with long core-collapse times. However, collision chains are typically triggered by primordial binary mergers and usually involve only two collisions. In our simulations, only three VMSs form through repeated collisions and reach $m_*>330\\,\\rm M_\\odot$, while most VMSs have $m_*<300\\,\\rm M_\\odot$ and form through primordial binary mergers. None constitute viable IMBH seeds, as their helium cores fall in the (pulsational) pair-instability regime. We form five IMBHs from stellar collisions involving stars at different evolutionary stages, while the dominant channel is the merger of stellar-mass black holes, producing twelve IMBHs. For properties typical of local YMCs, stellar collision chains are therefore inefficient in producing IMBHs more massive than $140\\,\\rm M_\\odot$, as most collisionally formed VMSs attain masses that fall in the pair-instability regime."}

This implies a minimum core separation, as shorter modes would not be able to grow. While many observations agree with core separations by theoretical predictions, some observations also show star forming cores which lie closer together than the minimum wavelength given by perturbation theory. We explore whether non-linear effects during the late stages of core growth can explain the discrepancy between theory and observations. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with the Ramses code to follow the evolution of initial perturbations within filaments and compare the measured growth rates to expectations from theoretical models. Non-linear evolution sets in as soon as the core mass reaches a value where the gravitational potential is not any longer dominated by the cylindrical potential of the filament but by the spherical potential of the Bonnor-Ebert sphere. Consequently, core collapse is not triggered by the loss of hydrostatic stability of the filament but by the loss of hydrostatic stability of the Bonnor-Ebert sphere. As the core is embedded in the filament, the maximum core mass is given by the pressure within the filament which results in a constant line-mass threshold for core collapse. As core collapse is triggered as soon as overdensities reach a certain line-mass, cores which form as large line-mass perturbations during filament formation can go into direct collapse even if their separation is closer than predicted by linear perturbation theory. Therefore, our result can explain the discrepancy between theory and observations."}

Submitted to Astronomy&Astrophysics 19/02/2026", "summary": "Neutral gas outflows play a crucial role in the baryon cycle of galaxies, their properties provide key insights into the transition from star formation to quiescence. In this work, we investigate the neutral gas outflow of 23 massive ($M_\\star = 10^{10.1-11.6}\\,\\rm M_\\odot$) quiescent galaxies (QGs) at z=2.82--4.61, selected from the JWST NIRSpec (R~1000) and NIRCam program DeepDive.

The z ~ 3.5 targets have $Δv$ similar to those of their local counterparts; they are also equivalent when compared in SFR--$Δv$ space.

For all NaI D detected systems, the inferred mass outflow rate can, in principle, suppress ongoing star formation; however, the outflows are unlikely to escape their hosts, suggesting recycling on relatively short timescales (~3--180 Myr), depending on the assumed potential and launching radius. All NaI D detected targets occupy the LI(N)ER region of the BPT diagram and/or are X-ray detected, but we find no strong correlation between ongoing AGN and the neutral outflow: 2/4 broad-line/X-ray AGNs are NaI D undetected -- yet, the outflows can be powered by fossil/episodic AGNs, and one broad-line target shows a possible P-Cygni profile that indicates strong outflows. As neutral outflows alone are not able to permanently quench star formation by removing gas in our sample at z ~ 3.5, the presence of gas cycling in and out of massive passive systems may instead be the signature of feedback-regulated quenching-maintenance processes."}

We propose a new guiding principle for modified-gravity theories, namely that closed timelike curves should always be {\\it harder} to obtain than in General Relativity. By demanding this, one can place powerful constraints on modified gravity. To elucidate this claim, we investigate modified-gravity EFTs on rotating black-hole backgrounds, focusing on the appearance/disappearance of closed timelike curves, and provide parameter bounds which only partly overlap with other approaches based on time delay. We construct perturbative rotating black-hole solutions in modified-gravity EFTs based on the Horndeski class and provide parameter bounds necessary to preserve causality and stability. Finally, we present a novel probe for the existence of closed timelike curves through quasinormal modes and black-hole echoes. This can be used to diagnose spacetime causality once next-generation gravitational-wave data becomes available."}

The Hubble classification provides structural information, the circular velocity curve classification$-$based on principal component analysis$-$ traces the total gravitational potential, and the Quenching classification$-$derived from H$_α$ equivalent width maps$-$indicates the spatial extent of quenched regions relative to star-forming areas. We find a clear separation of galaxy populations on the star formation rate-stellar mass plane. Late-type spirals with slow-rising circular velocity curves, represented by star-forming and quiescent-nuclear-ring galaxies, dominate the blue cloud. Early-type spirals with flat or round-peaked circular velocity curves belonging to centrally quiescent or mixed class populate the green valley, representing a transitional stage. Elliptical and lenticular galaxies with round- or sharp-peaked circular velocity curves from nearly retired or fully retired QSs reside on the red sequence. Furthermore, our results indicate that the morphological groups Sc-Scd, Sd-Sdm, and E1-E3 are characterized by a unique set of QSs and circular velocity curves, while galaxies with morphologies such as Sa-Sbc spread over multiple QSs and circular velocity curves. The distribution of the classification classes shows a tight link between galaxy structure, gravitational potential, and suppression of star-formation in the galaxies."}

Whether such smooth time-warp distortions are observable depends jointly on deformation strength and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), yet this relationship has not been quantified in a template-free framework. We study the detectability of these distortions using time-frequency representations derived from the continuous wavelet transform. Instead of reconstruction error alone, we examine trajectory-based statistics, in particular the evolution of the power-weighted frequency centroid. We find that environmental modulation can be detected using a single-sample statistic referenced to an isolated-binary distribution, without requiring matched templates. Across a grid of cumulative phase distortions and SNR, detection performance collapses onto a single scaling parameter defined as the product of phase distortion and SNR. The ROC-AUC follows a sigmoid transition in this parameter. Moderate distortions are detectable at low SNR, whereas smaller distortions require higher SNR. These results indicate that smooth environmental phase modulation is not generically absorbed by intrinsic waveform variability; instead, detectability is governed by a simple scaling between cumulative phase distortion and signal strength."}

The magnitude of rotation is relevant to estimating the total mass of UMa III/U1, which is critical in determining whether or not UMa III/U1 is in fact a UFD, or possibly a star cluster home to a significant binary fraction. A non-rotating model and a rotational model are fitted for the current total population of member stars of UMa III/U1, finding that a non-rotating model was preferred by a factor of $\\sim 5-12 \\times$. This was repeated on a reduced population of UMa III/U1, where potential contaminant stars were removed. A similar preference for non-rotation was found for these reduced populations.

We analytically derive the conditions for stability, determine the equilibrium radius and the corresponding minimum asymptotic energy, and show that small perturbations about this equilibrium lead to a stable oscillatory motion of the shell. The oscillation frequency is obtained explicitly and shown to increase with the shell mass and decrease with the charge of the central object. When the shell itself carries charge, its stability depends on the sign of this charge. Shells with the same sign as the central charge become progressively less stable, while oppositely charged shells exhibit enhanced stability due to the electrostatic attraction. These findings highlight the stabilizing role of electromagnetic interactions in Dyson-type thin-shell configurations within general relativity."}

Templates of the background fluctuations were constructed from a Principal Component Analysis decomposition of detector measurements outside the expected Field of View trajectory of dark photons. We found that the dark photon signal was consistent with zero, giving a new upper limit on the dark photon's kinetic mixing, $χ$, with masses between 0.6 meV and 1.4 meV.

The majority of the evidence for ``failed galaxy'' UDGs originates from spectroscopic observations targeting passive GC-rich UDGs, with a focus on those residing in galaxy clusters. In this work, we study the gas-rich, GC-rich group UDG MATLAS-42 and derive its stellar population properties using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager. We measure a redshift for the galaxy ($V_{\\rm R, \\star}=2433\\pm8$~km s$^{-1}$), confirming the previous assumptions that it is both part of the NGC~502 group and has an associated HI-reservoir ($V_{\\rm R,HI}=2423\\pm 15$~km s$^{-1}$). We measure integrated stellar populations and find the galaxy to be both young (mass-weighted age $=3.2^{+2.6}_{-1.5}$Gyr) and of average-to-low metallicity ($[M/H]=-1.19^{+0.42}_{-0.30}$ dex). When considering these properties in the context of the galaxy's formation, we note it likely does not follow the ``failed galaxy'' formation pathway commonly attributed to GC-rich, cluster UDGs, as it has experienced recent star formation. At most it started failed, however, it has recently rejuvenated its star formation. Finally, we build a toy model of the passive evolution of this galaxy, finding that its relative GC-richness (i.e., $M_{\\rm GC}/M_\\star$) will likely decrease with time as GCs slowly evaporate/disrupt to contribute to the stellar mass of the galaxy. Due to this, we hypothesise that it is likely not a low redshift analogue of the progenitor to a ``failed galaxy'' UDGs."}

Overall, the analysis indicates that $f(T)$ gravity is capable of reproducing the standard cosmological sequence within a consistent dynamical framework."}

We pay attention to the neutrino mass effects, so that the derivation of Boltzmann equations needs to specify the concrete form of interaction. We work in a model in which the DM-neutrino scatterings are induced by a dimension-six operator, and present the details for deriving the full Boltzmann hierarchy for DM and neutrinos, including a novel method to obtain the fluid approximation for modes entering the horizon. It is shown that our interaction can induce the dark acoustic oscillation in the DM-neutrino fluid, leaving distinct signatures on the CMB and matter power spectra. By using the latest CMB and BAO datasets from Planck, DESI and ACT, the constraint on today's DM-neutrino interaction parameter for the normal neutrino mass ordering reaches $u^0_{χ-ν} \\lesssim {\\cal O}(10^{-13})$, nearly nine orders stronger than that for temperature-independent case in the literature. This can be understood by noting that the scattering cross section increases nearly quadratically with cosmological temperature in the early universe, leading to enhanced effects. We have investigated alternative scenarios with different neutrino mass assumptions. In particular, models with degenerate neutrino masses give rise to weaker constraint of $u^0_{χ-ν} \\lesssim {\\cal O}(10^{-11})$, showing the importance to incorporate the realistic neutrino mass ordering in the fits. Finally, when employing the logarithmic flat prior for $u^0_{χ-ν}$, we have shown hints to a nonzero interaction at $95\\%$ CL by combining Planck, DESI and ACT data."}

While mergers have been extensively investigated in the local Universe, the evolution of their frequency and physical properties in the early Universe has yet to be fully understood. We investigate the role of mergers in a large spectroscopic sample of 1233 galaxies in the range 5<z<14 with good detection (S/N-pixel > 3) in JWST imaging, covering six different extragalactic fields. We identify mergers from rest-frame optical disturbances in F444W, using a combination of Gini, M-20, and Asymmetry parameters. We find a morphological merger fraction f_m that does not strongly evolve with redshift from z=0 to z ~ 8. The average f_m of our primary major merger condition (Gini+0.14xM-20 > 0.33, A>0.35) is ~ 5 %, which increases to ~13 % for major+minor merger tracers. Accounting for the evolving observability timescale of each tracer, we find that the merger rate is strongly increasing from z=1 to 7 by more than 1 dex, averaging ~ 2 merger/galaxy/Gyr at 5<z<10 for major mergers (in agreement with photometric pair studies), and a factor of 3 higher for minor+major mergers. We also perform SED modeling using available HST+JWST photometry to infer stellar masses and SFRs, using a non parametric star-formation history. We find that mergers at z > 5 have a significant impact, although significantly lower than at z<1, on the SFR of galaxies. When averaged over 10 Myr (comparable to the observability timescale of morphological disturbances), their SFRs are a factor of 1.7 higher than a mass and redshift matched sample of non-mergers, suggesting that mergers trigger new star-formation through short-lived powerful bursty episodes. Despite this, mergers contribute only by 5% - 10% to the mass build-up of galaxies in the redshift range explored."}

The Hubble classification provides structural information, the circular velocity curve classification$-$based on principal component analysis$-$ traces the total gravitational potential, and the Quenching classification$-$derived from H$_α$ equivalent width maps$-$indicates the spatial extent of quenched regions relative to star-forming areas. We find a clear separation of galaxy populations on the star formation rate-stellar mass plane. Late-type spirals with slow-rising circular velocity curves, represented by star-forming and quiescent-nuclear-ring galaxies, dominate the blue cloud. Early-type spirals with flat or round-peaked circular velocity curves belonging to centrally quiescent or mixed class populate the green valley, representing a transitional stage. Elliptical and lenticular galaxies with round- or sharp-peaked circular velocity curves from nearly retired or fully retired QSs reside on the red sequence. Furthermore, our results indicate that the morphological groups Sc-Scd, Sd-Sdm, and E1-E3 are characterized by a unique set of QSs and circular velocity curves, while galaxies with morphologies such as Sa-Sbc spread over multiple QSs and circular velocity curves. The distribution of the classification classes shows a tight link between galaxy structure, gravitational potential, and suppression of star-formation in the galaxies."}

We examined the LSBG population as identified via stellar and gaseous content using the MIGHTEE HI XMM-LSS early science data and the publicly available catalogs of optically identified LSBGs. There is currently little overlap between these datasets, with only three galaxies commonly detected. We performed surface brightness photometry of selected MIGHTEE HI detections to find 29 LSBGs, and 26 of these meet the size requirement (R_eff > 1.5 kpc) to be ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). Furthermore, we extracted HI spectra at the location of all optically identified galaxies, placing upper limits on the HI-to-stellar mass ratio in these systems. While the HI-identified population overall tends toward bluer colors, the HI-identified and the optically selected samples mostly overlap in mean effective surface brightness, effective radii, and color. Although it is not straightforward to discern why the HI-identified LSBGs were missed in optical searches, this work highlights the utility of HI surveys in finding these faint systems. The HI-identified LSBGs are gas rich compared to the general HI-selected population. Furthermore, three out of four HI-selected UDGs with available kinematics show no systematic offset from the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, although we are biased away from sources with low rotational velocities due to the low spectral resolution of the data. This work demonstrates the utility of HI observations for finding and characterizing the low surface brightness Universe."}

However, so far only few observations of their physical structure and interaction with the parental molecular cloud have been made. The high resolution and sensitivity of new instruments such as ALMA and the upgraded VLA allow us to fill this gap in our knowledge. We investigate the well known core-halo ultracompact HII region G31.41+0.31 and the surrounding molecular clump with the aim to determine the density and temperature of both the ionised and neutral gas, and possibly obtain a 3D picture of their spacial distribution. We take advantage of the full-band frequency coverage at 3 mm obtained with ALMA for the GUAPOS project to image the emission of a plethora of hydrogen recombination lines towards the G31.41+0.31 HII region as well as several molecular transitions which are tracers of medium-density ($\\sim$$10^4$--$10^6$ cm$^{-3}$) gas. The line data are complemented by continuum measurements obtained with the VLA at 1 cm and 7 mm. By fitting these lines also using a model that takes into account non-LTE effects we can investigate the density and temperature structure and the velocity field of the region. Our findings, based on a model fit accounting for non-LTE effects, indicate that the electron temperature of the HII region is mostly spanning a range between 5000 and 6000 K, while the density varies between 2500 and 7500 cm$^{-3}$. All in all, the distribution of these parameters as well as the corresponding velocity field hint at a cometary shaped HII region expanding away from the observer to the NW. The molecular gas appears to be still infalling towards the peak of the UC HII region, and its density and temperature are consistent with pressure confinement of the ionised gas to the SE."}

Combined with Herschel and APEX/ArTéMiS data, we derived high-resolution temperature and column-density maps. We quantify structural evolution using dense-fragment statistics, column-density PDFs, and $Δ$-variance analysis. From young to evolved regions, the maximum fragment mass increases from 8 to 490 $M_\\odot$, while the dense-gas mass fraction ($>0.5$ g cm$^{-2}$) rises from 0.4% to 9.6%.

Utilizing recent numerical analyses of central configurations--special equilibrium solutions to the Newtonian $N$-body problem--we uncover systematic spatial variations in nearest-neighbor particle separations correlated with the radial distance from the system's center of mass. We argue that these variations reflect a context-dependent, emergent effective geometry shaped by gravitational interactions, in accordance with Poincaré's assertion that measured geometry depends on the forces influencing measuring devices, and Einstein's view that rods and clocks define physical geometry through their local dynamics. By revisiting these foundational insights within a modern computational framework, we provide evidence that geometry in self-gravitating Newtonian systems is not a fixed background, but an emergent construct arising from internal physical interactions."}

In this study, I compute the gravitational response of solar oscillation modes using standard solar models generated with \\texttt{MESA}, and mode eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions calculated with \\texttt{GYRE}. I focus primarily on solar $g$ modes, evaluating their responses for degree $l=2$ and azimuthal orders $m=0$ and $m=2$. The analysis incorporates both the earlier proposed and the current updated LISA sensitivity curves, and I perform a comparative assessment with the TianQin mission in the relevant low-frequency band. To assess the robustness of the predicted signals, I estimate the gravitational responses using two different standard solar models based on the GS98 and AGSS09 abundance compilations. I find that the resulting signal responses are nearly identical for the two models, indicating that uncertainties in solar metallicity have a negligible impact on the detectability of solar $g$ modes by space-based interferometers."}

The advent of third-generation detectors like the Einstein Telescope (ET) will provide catalogs three orders of magnitudes larger than current ones, raising questions about the scalability and robustness of existing inference pipelines. We present a blinded mock data challenge that tests three public pipelines with distinct numerical implementations, namely, $\\texttt{ICAROGW}$, $\\texttt{CHIMERA}$, and $\\texttt{pymcpop-gw}$, on simulated ET observations containing the best $\\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ binary black hole mergers that can be observed in 1 year. We assess their computational performance, validate their agreement in a blinded setting, and forecast cosmological constraints. We find that, thanks to GPU acceleration, these pipelines can process the events expected from ET within a manageable timeframe. All pipelines recover consistent cosmological and population parameters. Assuming a flat $Λ$CDM model, we measure $H(z)$ at $z\\sim1.5$ with 2.4% precision, and achieve a mean precision on $H(z)$ of 2.8% across $0.7<z<1.8$ with a catalog of $\\sim 12,000$ high-S/N events. This corresponds to joint constraints of $\\sim 10%$ on $H_0$ and $\\sim 26%$ on $Ω_{\\rm m,0}$. We also identify the events that contribute mostly to constraining cosmological parameters, showing that low-distance sources near population features drive the constraining power on all cosmological parameters, while higher-distance events primarily constrain $Ω_{\\rm m,0}$. Our results establish a validated, performance-tested framework for spectral siren cosmology in the era of third-generation GW observatories."}

The constraints are obtained via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses of the full \\textit{Planck} temperature and polarization data combined with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6). For ordinary cosmic strings, we constrain the string tension $Gμ$, the string wiggliness parameter $α$, and the self-chopping efficiency $\\tilde{c}$. For cosmic superstrings, we constrain the fundamental string tension $Gμ_F$, the string coupling $g_s$, and a parameter $w$ describing the volume of the compact extra dimensions. In both cases, we find significantly tighter bounds on the string tension compared to previous analyses, obtaining $2σ$ upper limits of $Gμ< 3.66\\times10^{-8}$ and $Gμ_F < 1.38\\times10^{-8}$. We also discuss the significant prior-dependence of these results. The computational pipeline used in this work, including a modified version of \\texttt{CAMB} capable of computing CMB anisotropies sourced by any active network described via unequal-time correlators, is released publicly as \\texttt{CAMBactive} \\cite{Raidal_CAMBactive_CAMB_extension_2026}."}
