We then discuss certain requirements that must be\nsatisfied for compact models to be physically validated. Two distinct\nlimitations are taken into account to solve the field equations, including\ndifferent forms of the radial geometric component and anisotropy, which\nultimately leads to a couple of relativistic models. In both cases, solving the\ndifferential equations result in the appearance of integration constants. By\nequating the Schwarzschild exterior metric and spherical interior line element\non the interface, these constants are explicitly obtained. The disappearance of\nthe radial pressure on the hypersurface is also used in this context. We\nfurther use estimated radii and masses of six different stars to graphically\nvisualize the physical properties of new solutions. Both of our models are\ndeduced to be well-aligned with all physical requirements, indicating the\nsuperiority of the presence of anisotropy in compact stellar interiors over the\nperfect isotropic fluid content."}

Of particular interest are the class of control variates which are\nanalytically calculable, such as the recently introduced 'Zeldovich control\nvariates' for the power spectrum of matter and biased tracers. In this work we\npresent the construction of perturbative control variates in Eulerian and\nLagrangian perturbation theory, and adopt the matter bispectrum as a case\nstudy. Eulerian control variates are analytically tractable for all $n$-point\nfunctions, but we show that their correlation with the $N$-body $n$-point\nfunction decays at a rate proportional to the sum-of-squared wavenumbers,\nhampering their utility. We show that the Zeldovich approximation, while\npossessing an analytically calculable bispectrum, is less correlated at low-$k$\nthan its Eulerian counterpart. We introduce an alternative -- the 'shifted\ncontrol variate' -- which can be constructed to have the correct tree-level\n$n$-point function, is Zeldovich-resummed, and in principle has an analytically\ntractable bispectrum. We find that applying this shifted control variate to the\n$z=0.5$ matter bispectrum is equivalent to averaging over $10^4$ simulations\nfor the lowest-$k$ triangles considered. With a single $V=1({\\rm Gpc}/h)^3$\n$N$-body simulation, for a binning scheme with $N\\approx 1400$ triangles from\n$k_{\\rm min} = 0.04 h {\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ to $k_{\\rm \\max} = 0.47 h {\\rm\nMpc}^{-1}$, we obtain sub-2% precision for every triangle configuration\nmeasured.

The accumulation of dense gas and the boost of star formation\nefficiency (SFE) are considered to be the two main drivers of the starbursts.\nHowever, it is still unclear how each process operates on the scale of\nindividual star-forming clouds. Here, we present a high-resolution (2 Msun) RHD\nsimulation of a gas-rich dwarf galaxy merger using the RIGEL model to\ninvestigate how mergers affect the properties of the structure of dense\nstar-forming gas and the cloud-scale SFE. We track the evolution of sub-virial\ndense clouds in the simulation by mapping them across successive snapshots\ntaken at intervals of 0.2 Myr. We found that the merger triggers a 130 times\nhigher SFR and shortens the galaxy-wide gas-depletion time by two orders of\nmagnitude compared to those of two isolated galaxies. However, the depletion\ntime of individual clouds and their lifetime distribution remained unchanged\nover the simulation period. The cloud life cycles and cloud-scale SFE are\ndetermined by the local stellar feedback rather than environmental factors\nregardless of the merger process, and the integrated SFE ($\\epsilon_{\\rm int}$)\nof clouds in complex environments is still well described by an $\\epsilon_{\\rm\nint}-\\Sigma_{\\rm tot}$ relation found in idealized isolated-cloud experiments.\nDuring the peak of the starburst, the median integrated SFE only changed by\n0.17-0.33 dex lower compared to the value when the galaxies are not\ninteracting. The merger boosts the SFR primarily through the accumulation and\ncompression of dense gas fueling star formation. Strong tidal torques assemble\n$>10^ 5$ Msun clouds that seed massive star clusters. The average separation\nbetween star-forming clouds decreases during the merger, which in turn\ndecreases the cloud--cluster spatial decorrelation from >1 kpc to 0.1 kpc\ndepicted by tuning fork diagrams."}

The surface brightness of the\nlensing-corrected source shows two mini-lobes separated by 642 pc in\nprojection, with evidence of multiple hotspots that have brightness\ntemperatures of 10^8.6 to 10^9.2 K, and a total luminosity density of 10^26.3 W\n/ Hz.

On the other hand, seven-point SF enables us to probe\nsmall-scale turbulence by removing large-scale fluctuations, which is difficult\nto achieve with the two-point SFs. In the seven-point SFs, we find break\nfeatures at scales of 34-84 pc, with a median scale of $\\sim$50 pc.

We study the trends in MC properties over time to analyse their\nphysical structure as they evolve.

No evolution\nin the F356W+F444W bar length is measured from $z = 4$ to $z = 1$, which has a\nmean of 3.6\\,kpc, but a slight increase of about 1\\,kpc towards $z = 1$ is\nmeasured in the F200W sample, which has a mean of 2.9\\,kpc. The bar sample is\nshorter in the short-wavelength channel due to the better physical spatial\nresolution; however, we also suggest that dust obscuration plays a role. We\nfind that the correlation between bar length and galaxy mass for massive\ngalaxies observed at $z < 1$ is not seen at $z > 1$. By adding samples of\nbarred galaxies at $z<1$, we show that there is a modest increase in the bar\nlength ($\\approx 2$\\,kpc) towards $z=0$, but bars longer than $\\approx8$\\,kpc\nare only found at $z<1$. We show that bars and discs grow in tandem, for the\nbar length normalised by disc size does not evolve from $z = 4$ to $z = 0$. Not\nonly is a significant population of bars forming beyond $z = 1$, but our\nresults also show that some of these bars are as long and strong as the average\nbar at $z\\approx0$."}

This paper explores further the scale function source term to\nconstruct a theory on Lyra manifolds which contains proper generalizations of\nboth Brans-Dicke gravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory. It\nis shown that the symmetry group of gravitational theories on the Lyra geometry\ncomprises not only coordinate transformations but also local transformations of\nlength units, so that the Lyra function is the conformal factor which locally\nfixes the unit of length. By performing a Lyra transformation to a frame in\nwhich the unit of length is globally fixed, it is shown that General Relativity\nis obtained from the Lyra Scalar-Tensor Theory (LyST). Through the same\nprocedure, even in the presence of matter fields, it is found that Brans-Dicke\ngravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory are obtained from\ntheir Lyra counterparts. It is argued that this approach is consistent with the\nMach-Dicke principle, since the strength of gravity in Brans-Dicke-Lyra is\ncontrolled by the scale function. It might be possible that any known\nscalar-tensor theory can be naturally geometrized by considering a particular\nLyra frame, for which the scalar field is the function which locally controls\nthe unit of length. The Jordan-Einstein frame conundrum is also assessed from\nthe perspective of Lyra transformations, it is shown that the Lyra geometry\nmakes explicit that the two frames are only different representations of the\nsame theory, so that in the Einstein frame the unit of length varies locally.\nThe Lyra formalism is then shown to be better suited for exploring\nscalar-tensor gravity, since in its well-defined structure the conservation of\nthe energy-momentum tensor and geodesic motion are assured in the Einstein\nframe."}

The\nDehnen method, a new procedure to derive bar pattern speeds from kinematics of\nparticles in N-body simulations, is applied to the LMC stellar populations.

Here we report imaging of a gravitationally lensed CSO at a\nredshift of 2.059 using very long baseline interferometry at 1.7 GHz. The data\nare imaged using Bayesian forward modelling deconvolution, which reveals a\nspectacularly extended and thin gravitational arc, and several resolved\nfeatures within the lensed images. The surface brightness of the\nlensing-corrected source shows two mini-lobes separated by 642 pc in\nprojection, with evidence of multiple hotspots that have brightness\ntemperatures of 10^8.6 to 10^9.2 K, and a total luminosity density of 10^26.3 W\n/ Hz. By combining the well-resolved radio source morphology with previous\nmulti-wavelength studies, we conclude that this object is likely a CSO of type\n2, and that the properties are consistent with the bow-shock model for compact\nradio sources.

To mitigate these effects, we use\nBalrog synthetic source injections in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 data to\ncalculate detection rate variations and classification rates as functions of\nsurvey properties. We show that these rates are nearly separable with respect\nto survey properties and can be estimated with sufficient statistics from the\nsynthetic catalogs. Applying these corrections reduces the standard deviation\nof relative detection rates across the DES footprint by a factor of five, and\nour corrections significantly change the inferred linear density of the Phoenix\nstream when including faint objects.

This is the largest collection\nof spatially resolved CO + HI observations beyond the local Universe (z>0.05)\nto date. While the HI-detected parent sample spans a range of stellar masses,\nstar formation rates (SFR), and environments, we only directly detect CO in the\nhighest stellar mass galaxies, log(M_*/M_Sun)>10.0, with SFRs greater than ~2\nM_Sun/yr. The detected CO has the kinematic signature of a rotating disk,\nconsistent with the HI. We stack the CO non-detections and find a mean H_2 mass\nof log(M_H2/M_Sun) = 8.46 in galaxies with a mean stellar mass of\nlog(M_*/M_Sun) = 9.35. In addition to high stellar masses and SFRs, the systems\ndetected in CO are spatially larger, have redder overall colors, and exhibit\nbroader (stacked) line widths. The CO emission is spatially coincident with\nboth the highest stellar mass surface density and star forming region of the\ngalaxies, as revealed by the 1.4 GHz continuum emission. We interpret the\nredder colors as the molecular gas being coincident with dusty regions of\nobscured star formation. The 14 HI detections show a range of morphologies, but\nthe HI reservoir is always more extended than the CO. Finally, we compare with\nsamples in the literature and find mild evidence for evolution in the molecular\ngas reservoir and H_2-to-HI gas ratio with redshift in HI flux-limited samples.\nWe show that the scatter in the HI, and HI-to-stellar mass ratio is too great\nto conclusively measure evolution below z=0.2, and is even extremely difficult\nbelow z=0.4. Detections from CHILES are likely to be the only individual\ngalaxies detected in HI between 0.1<z<0.23 for the foreseeable future due to\nthe severity of satellite radio frequency interference, and its preferential\nimpact on short baselines which dominate contemporary HI surveys."}

Throughout\nthis infall process, the galaxy's atmosphere is subjected to ram pressure from\na headwind, leading to the stripping morphology observed in its tail. The\nmorphological evolution is affected by the properties of the surrounding ICM\nsuch as magnetic fields and viscosity. In this Letter, we perform 3D\nBraginskii-magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the FLASH code with varied ICM\nviscosity models. Specifically, we explore four models: an inviscid case,\nunsuppressed isotropic viscosity, unsuppressed anisotropic viscosity, and\nanisotropic viscosity suppressed by plasma instabilities. Our findings indicate\nthat the isotropic viscosity case effectively suppresses hydrodynamic\ninstabilities and shows strong viscous heating and the least mixing with the\nICM, enabling the formation of long, coherent tails. The inviscid model has the\nshortest tail due to vigorous mixing, and the models with anisotropic viscosity\nare in between. The model with suppressed anisotropic viscosity due to plasma\ninstabilities exhibits enhanced turbulence in the galactic tail and a\nconcurrent limitation in viscous heating compared to the model neglecting\nplasma instabilities. These findings highlight the significant impact of ICM\nplasma physics on the processes of ram pressure stripping of galaxies."}

A particularly promising route\nto an initial detection is to cross-correlate tomographic 21-cm maps with\nspectroscopically confirmed Lyman-$\\alpha$ emitters (LAEs). High-redshift LAEs\npreferentially reside in ionized bubbles that are strongly anticorrelated with\nthe surrounding neutral regions traced by 21-cm observations. In this work, we\nstudy the prospect of detecting such a cross-correlation signal by stacking\n21-cm image cubes around LAEs using a current-generation 21-cm instrument --\nthe Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA). Our forecast adopts a\nrealistic mapping pipeline to generate foreground-free 21-cm image cubes. The\nstatistical properties of these images, arising from the complex instrumental\nresponse, are carefully accounted for. We further introduce a physically\nmotivated signal template calibrated on the THESAN radiation-hydrodynamic\nsimulations, which connects the cross-correlation amplitude to the global\nneutral fraction. Our results show that a sample of ~50 spectroscopically\nconfirmed LAEs is sufficient to begin constraining the reionization history.\nThese results represent an important preparatory step toward joint analyses of\n21-cm experiments with upcoming wide-area, high-redshift galaxy surveys from\nEuclid and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope."}

The goal of this paper is to\ninvestigate whether this model is sufficient to fully characterize the\nsmall-scale data extracted from spectroscopic surveys and to gauge how adding\nor removing degrees of freedom impact the inference regarding the galaxy-halo\nconnection. After extensive validation with realistic mock data, we use\nBasilisk, a highly constraining Bayesian hierarchical tool to model the\nkinematics and abundance of satellite galaxies, to test the standard CLF model\nagainst a slew of more flexible variants. In particular, we test whether the\nSDSS data favour any of these variants in terms of a goodness-of-fit\nimprovement, and identify the models that are sufficiently flexible, beyond\nwhich additional model freedom is not demanded by the data. We show that some\nof these additional degrees of freedom, which have hitherto not been\nconsidered, result in a drastic improvement of the fit and cause significant\nchanges in the inferred galaxy-halo connection. This highlights that an\nempirical model comes with an implicit prior about the parametrization form,\nwhich needs to be addressed to ensure that it is sufficiently flexible to\ncapture the complexity of the data and to safeguard against a biased inference."}
