It provides a first-principles characterization of the resonance associated with avoided crossings near EPs, an effect that conventional QNM analysis cannot fully capture. Employing a phenomenological environmental black-hole model with the hyperboloidal framework, we identify near-coalescence of both QNM eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, and directly demonstrate that the resonance produces enhanced mode contributions in the time domain, resulting in characteristic departures from exponentially damped oscillations. Our formulation further reveals that the EP frequency, given by the averaged value of the resonant modes, emerges as the physically relevant observable in the near-EP regime, and offers a robust foundation for modeling and extracting resonant ringdown signals."}

We show that this result does not hold in the same class of solutions considered as physically viable near FLRW cosmological models, with the heat conduction vector interpreted as a peculiar velocity field. We also discuss the similarities and differences between the gravitational ``arrow of time'' and the gravitational entropy formalism of Clifton, Ellis and Tavakol."}

From the point of view of the FLRW observer, gathering data from sources at cosmological redshift $\\widehat{z}$, this functional generates a geometry--structure--growth contribution ${Ω_Λ(\\widehat{z})}$ to the FLRW cosmological constant ${\\widehatΩ_Λ}$. This redshift--dependent contribution erodes the interpretation of ${\\widehatΩ_Λ}$ as representing constant dark energy. In particular, ${Ω_Λ(\\widehat{z})}$ becomes significantly large at very low $\\widehat{z}$, where structures dominate the cosmological landscape. At the pivotal galaxy cluster scale, where cosmological expansion decouples from the local gravitation dynamics, we get ${Ω_Λ(\\widehat{z})/\\widehatΩ_Λ}\\,=\\,\\mathscr{O}(1)$, showing that late--epoch structures provide an effective field contribution to the FLRW cosmological constant that is of the same order of magnitude as its assumed value. We prove that ${Ω_Λ(\\widehat{z})}$ is generated by a scale-dependent effective field governed by structure formation and related to the comparison between the idealized FLRW past light cone and the actual physical past light cone. These results are naturally framed in the mainstream FLRW cosmology; they do not require exotic fields and provide a natural setting for analyzing the coincidence problem, leading to an interpretative shift in the current understanding of constant dark energy."}

By employing the MIT bag model equation of state, we establish a relation between the metric potentials, leading to an exact solution of the field equations for an anisotropic fluid configuration coupled with a non-linear electromagnetic source. The interior spacetime is smoothly matched with the exterior geometry calculated from the theoretical setup of $f(Q)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity using the Darmois-Israel junction conditions, ensuring the continuity of the metric functions and their derivatives at the stellar boundary. The physical viability of the model is examined through regularity, energy, and causality conditions, all of which are satisfied throughout the stellar interior. The study highlights how the pressure anisotropy, the propagation speeds of sound, and the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff balance condition are interconnected, showing that the star remains in mechanical equilibrium only when the gravitational, hydrostatic, electric, and anisotropic contributions counterbalance one another appropriately. The dynamical stability of the configuration is further supported by the requirement $Γ> \\tfrac{4}{3}$ for the adiabatic index, indicating resilience against small radial perturbations. The plots of compactness, surface redshift, and the mass--radius profiles confirm that all physical quantities behave regularly and vary smoothly throughout the stellar interior.

Utilizing the TNG galaxy-formation model, the DREAMS simulations incorporate both baryonic physics and cosmological uncertainties for a large sample of galaxies with diverse environments and formation histories. We investigate the relative impact of the physical uncertainty from the galaxy-formation model on predicted satellite properties using four metrics: the satellite stellar mass function, radial distribution, inner slope of dark matter density profile, and stellar half-light radius. We compare these predictions to observations from the SAGA Survey and the DREAMS N-body simulations and find that uncertainties from baryonic physics modeling are subdominant to the scatter arising from halo-to-halo variance. Where baryonic modeling does affect satellites, the supernova wind energy has the largest effect on the satellite properties that we investigate. Specifically, increased supernova wind energy suppresses the stellar mass of satellites and results in more extended stellar half-light radii. The adopted wind speed has only a minor impact, and other astrophysical and cosmological parameters show no measurable effect. Our findings highlight the robustness of satellite properties against uncertainties in baryonic physics modeling."}

However, it has been shown previously that the RSL approximation leads to photon non-conservation in some regimes. I show that these missing photons can be counted exactly for some numerical schemes. Adding them back into a simulation, however, is a much harder task. I show one example of such a scheme, which achieves sub-percent accuracy on simple tests. Unfortunately, the scheme performs much worse on semi-realistic simulations of cosmic reionization, leading to a faster overlap and significant errors in the point-to-point comparison of the RSL radiation field with the reference simulation that maintains the full speed of light for the radiative transfer."}

These so-called \"little red dots\" (LRDs) often exhibit broad Balmer emission lines, indicative of the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). They generally lack detection of X-ray, radio, and mid-IR radiation, which is fundamentally different from typical AGNs. Various models, including super-Eddington-accreting black holes enshrouded in dense and dust-poor gas, have been proposed to explain these features. However, the nature of LRDs remains debated, and their evolutionary fate is unclear. Here we report two unusual LRDs at redshift z = 2.868 and 2.925 that are in a transitional phase towards typical AGNs. Their V-shaped SEDs, compact optical morphology, and broad emission lines satisfy the defining criteria of LRDs. On the other hand, they exhibit intense X-ray, radio, and mid-IR radiation that is much stronger than previously known LRDs. These hybrid properties suggest that the dense gas envelope around their central black holes is dispersing, allowing high-energy photons and radio emission to escape. Meanwhile, a dust torus is forming. This finding provides a direct insight into the nature of LRDs and indicates that at least some LRDs will evolve into AGNs or quasars at later times."}

Starting from the master equation governing axial perturbations, we impose ingoing boundary conditions at the event horizon and normalizable (Dirichlet) behavior at the AdS boundary. Following the approach of Jansen, we recast the radial equation into a linear generalized eigenvalue problem by using an ingoing Eddington--Finkelstein formulation, compactifying the radial domain, and regularizing the asymptotic coefficients. The resulting problem is solved using a Chebyshev--Lobatto pseudospectral discretization. We compute the fundamental quasinormal mode frequencies for both the purely electric ($Q_m=0$) and purely magnetic ($Q_e=0$) sectors, emphasizing the role of the nonlinearity parameter $β$ and the effective charge magnitude $Q$. Our results show that increasing either $β$ or $Q$ raises both the oscillation frequency $ω_R$ and the damping rate $-ω_I$, leading to faster but more rapidly decaying ringdown profiles. Nonlinear electrodynamics breaks the isospectrality between electric and magnetic configurations: magnetic modes are systematically less oscillatory and more weakly damped than their electric counterparts. For sufficiently large $β$ and small $Q_m$, the fundamental mode becomes purely imaginary ($ω_R \\approx 0$), in agreement with the absence of a trapping potential barrier in this regime. These findings reveal qualitative signatures of nonlinear electromagnetic effects on black hole perturbations and may have implications for high-field or high-charge astrophysical environments."}

Working directly with the Riemann-tensor two-point function and exploiting the extreme adiabaticity of cosmological GW propagation, we show that phase diffusion, rather than amplitude attenuation or mode mixing, is the unique leading-order imprint of microscopic curvature fluctuations. Our main theoretical result is a universality theorem: for any quantum-gravity model whose curvature fluctuations possess a finite correlation length, the accumulated phase variance grows linearly with distance, independent of the underlying microphysics. This diffusive scaling contrasts sharply with coherent astrophysical effects and with nonlocal models. The frequency exponent therefore becomes a clean spectral discriminator, separating string-foam recoil, holographic or scale-invariant noise, and causal-set discreteness. We obtain these results from first principles by evaluating the projected Riemann correlator along null geodesics and determining the exact conditions under which deviations from universality can arise. Finally, we outline a hierarchical Bayesian strategy for measuring this effect with LIGO, LISA, and Pulsar Timing Arrays. Although standard Planck-scale fluctuations remain far below current sensitivity, this framework provides a sharp and falsifiable test of exotic quantum-spacetime scenarios, particularly those with macroscopic correlation lengths or strong energy dependence."}

Instead of modeling the full six-dimensional phase-space distribution function $f\\left(\\vec{x},\\vec{v}\\right)$ of observed kinematic tracers, we model the conditional velocity distribution $p\\left(\\vec{v}\\mid\\vec{x}\\right)$, which is unaffected by a purely spatial selection function.

Our results reveal a clear, distance-decreasing dipole that remains coherent across shells, with subdominant higher-order multipoles, and the octupole fit capturing the main anisotropic features except in sparsely sampled or SDSS-dominated shells. The direction and amplitude of the dipole depend on whether the observed radial recessional velocities are corrected for peculiar velocities or not. If the correction is not applied, the dipole aligns with the major gravitational structures in the local universe. If it is applied, a global dipole still seems to be present, but the signal is much weaker and with much lower statistical significance. This decrease in the amplitude of the dipole supports the idea of a differential expansion rate in our universe, but does not clarify whether the origin is astrophysical or cosmological. Finally, we verify that, while this anisotropy could influence local measurements of the Hubble constant, its effect on the large-scale Hubble tension appears to be limited, as the distribution of galaxies hosting SNeIa, both used as calibrators to constrain $H_0$ and in the Hubble-flow, does not show a strong correlation with the dipole signal."}

Most existing studies, however, are restricted to unbound orbits. The finite-distance deflection angle, which assumes both the source and observer to be located at finite distances, motivates us to investigate the bending of bound orbits. In this work, we broaden the GW method to bound orbits of massive particles in stationary axisymmetric (SAS) spacetimes, following our previous extension in static spherically symmetric (SSS) backgrounds [Huang et al., Phys. Rev. D 107, 104046 (2023)]. By employing our generalized GW method for SAS spacetimes [Huang et al., J. Cosmol. Astropart.

This division enables the application of the GW method -- originally developed for unbound orbits -- to each segment in a consistent manner. (b) We overcome the limitation associated with the loss of positive definiteness of the Jacobi-Maupertuis Randers-Finsler (JMRF) metric, which occurs because bound massive particles have energies below unity. To show the practical implementation of our approach, we carry out the calculation in Kerr spacetime and obtain the deflection angle between two arbitrary points along the bound orbit of massive particles."}

We perform SED fits to both components, revealing the LRD to be best fitted with a black hole star (BH*) model and a substantial host galaxy, and the blue companion with an extremely young, emission-line dominated star-forming nebula. A383-LRD1 represents the second known multiply-imaged LRD detected to date, following A2744-QSO1, and to our knowledge, the first LRD system with a confirmed detection of [C $_{II}$]$\\lambda158 \\ μ$m emission from ALMA observations. Thanks to lensing magnification, this system opens a unique door to study the relation between a LRD, its host galaxy, and its environment, and represents a prime candidate for deep JWST spectroscopy and high-resolution ALMA follow-up observations."}

Hydrus A shows properties consistent with quenching driven by cosmic reionization, cosmic-web interactions, or internal feedback. LEDA 486718 is an isolated star forming dwarf. Cetus B appears quenched and morphologically disturbed, making it a low-mass satellite or backsplash candidate, while Sculptor 26 is red and seemingly gas-poor but displays signs of recent activity, consistent with a transitional evolutionary state.

In this study, we establish a system in which the GCJG and a pressureless dark matter fluid exchange energy via a linear interaction term, $Q \\propto ρ_x$, being $ρ_{x}$ the dark energy density. By solving the conservation equations, we derive analytical expressions for the evolution of the dark energy and dark matter densities. The thermodynamic properties of this interacting system are then thoroughly analyzed. The thermodynamic analysis reveals that both dark components maintain positive temperatures, ensuring stability. Notably, the dark energy component transitions to a phantom regime in the past, a feature of interest for recent cosmological observations, without violating thermodynamic principles. The total entropy production is shown to be in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics. Furthermore, an analysis of the specific heats suggests that while the dark matter sector remains thermodynamically stable, the dark energy sector undergoes a late-time phase transition, consistent with its entering into the phantom domain at effective level."}

Their positions and dynamics provide insight into cluster formation and constrain kinematic decoupling timescales between stars and gas. However, because of their strong extinction and young age, embedded YSOs are mainly visible at infrared wavelengths and thus absent from astrometric surveys such as Gaia. We measured the proper motions of 6,769 sources toward the NGC 2024 cluster in the Flame Nebula using multi-epoch near-infrared observations from three ESO public surveys: VISIONS, VHS, and the VISTA/VIRCAM science verification program. Cross-validation of our results with Gaia using optically visible stars shows excellent agreement, with uncertainties on the same order of magnitude. For 362 YSO candidates identified from the literature, we derived proper motions on the order of <5 mas/yr with mean measurement uncertainties of ~0.22 mas/yr. This is the first homogeneous proper motion measurement of this quality for more than half of these stars. For Class I and flat-spectrum sources, our results provide a >13-fold increase in available proper motion measurements. We analyzed the positional and kinematic differences between YSO classes and confirmed a previously reported inside-out age segregation from younger to older stars, likely driven by an outward movement of older stars. No evidence of prolonged hierarchical assembly was found. Instead, the results support a rapid (<1 Myr) cluster collapse. This scenario also accounts for the observed slightly higher 1D velocity dispersion of Class I sources relative to Class flat objects. YSO radial velocities generally align with the gas velocities measured from 12CO(3-2), HNC(1-0), HCN(1-0), and show a weaker correlation with N_2H+(1-0). Some Class II and III objects appear to be already decoupling."}

In contrast to the widely used Kerr--Melvin metric, the Kerr--BR spacetime is of algebraic type~D, admits a clear asymptotic structure, and allows for a systematic analytic treatment of geodesics. By analyzing the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), we find that the external magnetic field consistently pushes the ISCO to larger radii \\(r_{\\rm ISCO}\\) for all spin configurations considered. Counterintuitively, despite this outward radial shift, the ISCO orbital frequency \\(Ω_{\\rm ISCO}\\) increases monotonically with the magnetic-field strength, leading to a robust ``blue-shift'' of the gravitational-wave cutoff frequency. We further show that retrograde orbits are significantly more sensitive to magnetic fields than prograde orbits, and identify a frequency crossover phenomenon in which magnetic corrections can invert the usual spin--frequency hierarchy at the ISCO. Finally, employing a semi-analytic adiabatic evolution scheme driven by exact geodesic relations and a leading-order quadrupole flux, we generate inspiral waveforms and quantify the substantial dephasing induced by the magnetic field. Our results indicate that large-scale magnetic environments can leave observable imprints in EMRI signals for future space-based detectors such as LISA, TianQin, and Taiji, and that neglecting such effects in waveform models may introduce non-negligible biases in parameter estimation, particularly for the black-hole spin."}

Similar modulations may also arise from orbital eccentricity, raising the possibility of degeneracies that could lead to false microlensing claims. We investigate the extent to which eccentric binary black hole (BBH) signals can mimic microlensing signatures produced by an isolated point-mass lens. With a simulated population of eccentric signals using numerical relativity simulations and \\texttt{TEOBResumS-Dalí} waveform model, we perform a Bayesian model-comparison study, supported by a complementary \\textit{mismatch} analysis. We find a strong degeneracy for high eccentricities, low total masses, and high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs): under these conditions, quasicircular microlensed model can be strongly favored over quasicircular unlensed model, even when the true signal is unlensed. For moderate SNRs ($\\sim 30$), binaries with $M_\\mathrm{tot}\\lesssim 100\\,M_\\odot$ and eccentricity $e \\gtrsim 0.4$ are particularly susceptible to misclassifications. In such cases, inferred microlens parameters exhibit well-constrained posteriors despite being unphysical. Crucially, the degeneracy is completely removed when the recovery uses waveform models that incorporate eccentricity, which overwhelmingly favors the eccentric hypothesis over microlensing. Our results demonstrate that any event exhibiting strong Bayesian evidence for microlensing should also be analyzed with eccentric waveform models and vice-versa to avoid false positives and biased astrophysical inference.

In linear theory, these perturbations represent local, compensated variations in the ratio between the baryon and CDM densities; they freeze in amplitude at late times, with an RMS amplitude of $1.5\\%$ on the Lagrangian scale of a $10^{11}\\,\\rm M_\\odot$ halo ($0.85\\, \\rm{Mpc}$). Although such perturbations arise naturally within $Λ$CDM, most cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models to date omit them. These perturbations are strongly anti-correlated with the matter overdensity field such that halos form with baryon fractions below the cosmic mean, with earlier-collapsing halos exhibiting stronger baryonic suppression. To isolate the galaxy response, we analyse three hydrodynamical simulations with identical initial matter overdensity fields that: i) include isocurvature modes, ii) omit them, or iii) invert their amplitude. At $z=8$, isocurvature perturbations reduce the mean baryon fraction and star formation rates of resolved halos by $ 5\\%$ and $ 12\\%$, respectively, relative to the null-isocurvature case. These effects are almost independent of halo mass and diminish steadily with time, reaching $ 0.1\\%$ and $ 1\\%$ by $z=0$. We develop a model based on spherical collapse that accurately reproduces the mean baryon fraction suppression. As high-redshift observations become increasingly routine, incorporating isocurvature perturbations into simulations and semi-analytic models will be important for robust predictions of early galaxy and black hole formation in the JWST era."}

Deep learning provides a powerful alternative to traditional inference, but existing neural models typically lack the flexibility to handle variations in data analysis settings. Such variations accommodate imperfect observations or are required for specialized tests, and could include changes in detector configurations, overall frequency ranges, or localized cuts. We introduce a flexible transformer-based architecture paired with a training strategy that enables adaptation to diverse analysis settings at inference time. Applied to parameter estimation, we demonstrate that a single flexible model -- called Dingo-T1 -- can (i) analyze 48 gravitational-wave events from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Observing Run under a wide range of analysis configurations, (ii) enable systematic studies of how detector and frequency configurations impact inferred posteriors, and (iii) perform inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency tests probing general relativity. Dingo-T1 also improves median sample efficiency on real events from a baseline of 1.4% to 4.2%. Our approach thus demonstrates flexible and scalable inference with a principled framework for handling missing or incomplete data -- key capabilities for current and next-generation observatories."}

Cra2 is a Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellite with extremely cold kinematics, but a huge size similar to the Small Magellanic Cloud, which may be difficult to explain within collisionless cold dark matter. We identify 143 Cra2 members, of which 114 belong to the galaxy's main body and 29 are deemed part of its stellar stream. We confirm that Cra2 is dynamically cold (central velocity dispersion $2.51^{+0.33}_{-0.30}\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$) and also discover a $\\approx$7$σ$ velocity gradient consistent with its tidal debris track.

In this paper, we investigate the implications of zero-point length $l_0$-corrected gravity for gravitational baryogenesis and early universe thermodynamics, deriving constraints on $l_0$ from observational baryon asymmetry data. We observe that under the condition of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, $l_0$ generates $\\dot{\\mathcal{R}}\\neq 0$ during radiation epoch, where $\\mathcal{R}$ is the Ricci scalar.

We also find that HZ10 falls below the local scaling relation between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity, suggesting inefficient ISM dust growth.

We then formulate the problem as a boundary value problem (BVP) and highlight the numerical pathologies that may arise, together with possible strategies to prevent them.

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "Type-2 quasars (QSO2s) are AGN seen through a significant amount of dust and gas that obscures the central supermassive black hole and the broad line region. Despite this, recent mid-infrared spectra of the central 0.5-1.1 kpc of five QSO2s at z~0.1, obtained with the MRS module of JWST/MIRI, revealed 9.7, 18, and 23 micron silicate features in emission in two of them. This indicates that the high angular resolution of JWST/MIRI now allows us to peer into their nuclear region, exposing some of the directly illuminated dusty clouds that produce silicate emission. To test this, we fitted the nuclear mid-infrared spectrum of the QSO2 with the strongest silicate features, J1010, with two different sets of torus models implemented in an updated version of the Bayesian tool {\\tt BayesClumpy}. These are the CLUMPY and the CAT3D-WIND models. The CAT3D-WIND model is preferred by the observations based on the marginal likelihood and fit residuals, although the two torus models successfully reproduce the spectrum by means of intermediate covering factors ($\\rm C_T=0.45\\pm^{0.26}_{0.18}$ and $\\rm C_T=0.66\\pm^{0.16}_{0.17}$ for the CLUMPY and CAT3D-WIND models) and low inclinations ($\\rm i=50^\\circ\\pm^{8^\\circ}_{9^\\circ}$ and $\\rm i=13^\\circ\\pm^{7^\\circ}_{6^\\circ}$). Indeed, four of the five QSO2s with JWST/MIRI observations, including J1010, are in the blowout or ''forbidden'' region of the Eddington ratio-column density diagram, indicating that they are actively clearing gas and dust from their nuclear regions, leading to reduced covering factors. This is in contrast with Seyfert 2 galaxies observed with JWST, which are in the ''permitted'' regions of the diagram and show 9.7 micron silicate features in absorption. This supports a scenario where the more luminous the AGN and the higher their Eddington ratio, the lower the torus covering factor, driven by radiation pressure on dusty gas."}

From the point of view of the FLRW observer, gathering data from sources at cosmological redshift $\\widehat{z}$, this functional generates a geometry--structure--growth contribution ${Ω_Λ(\\widehat{z})}$ to the FLRW cosmological constant ${\\widehatΩ_Λ}$. This redshift--dependent contribution erodes the interpretation of ${\\widehatΩ_Λ}$ as representing constant dark energy. In particular, ${Ω_Λ(\\widehat{z})}$ becomes significantly large at very low $\\widehat{z}$, where structures dominate the cosmological landscape. At the pivotal galaxy cluster scale, where cosmological expansion decouples from the local gravitation dynamics, we get ${Ω_Λ(\\widehat{z})/\\widehatΩ_Λ}\\,=\\,\\mathscr{O}(1)$, showing that late--epoch structures provide an effective field contribution to the FLRW cosmological constant that is of the same order of magnitude as its assumed value. We prove that ${Ω_Λ(\\widehat{z})}$ is generated by a scale-dependent effective field governed by structure formation and related to the comparison between the idealized FLRW past light cone and the actual physical past light cone. These results are naturally framed in the mainstream FLRW cosmology; they do not require exotic fields and provide a natural setting for analyzing the coincidence problem, leading to an interpretative shift in the current understanding of constant dark energy."}

We use the SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper to spatially map the physical conditions of the Trifid Nebula (M 20), a Galactic H II region ionized by a single mid-type O star, at 0.24 pc resolution. We exploit various emission lines (e.g., Hydrogen recombination lines and collisionally excited lines, including also faint auroral lines) and compute spatially resolved maps of [O II] and [S II] electron densities; [N II], [O II], [S II], [S III] electron temperatures; and the ionic oxygen abundances. We find internal variations of electron density that result from the ionization front, along with a negative radial gradient. However, we do not find strong gradients or structures in the electron temperature and the total oxygen abundance, making the Trifid Nebula a relatively homogeneous H II region at the observed spatial scale. We compare these spatially resolved properties with equivalent integrated measurements of the Trifid Nebula and find no significant variations between integrated and spatially resolved conditions. This isolated H II region, ionized by a single O-star, represents a test case of an ideal Strömgren sphere. The physical conditions in the Trifid Nebula behave as expected, with no significant differences between integrated and resolved measurements."}

Using the Cosmicflows-4 catalogue, we mapped the angular and radial variations of $H_0$ in radial shells with a distance modulus $μ\\in [29,36]$ (approximately corresponding to $[20,100]$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc) and equal-area sky patches, applied adaptive weighing, and fitted spherical harmonics up to the octupole. Our results reveal a clear, distance-decreasing dipole that remains coherent across shells, with subdominant higher-order multipoles, and the octupole fit capturing the main anisotropic features except in sparsely sampled or SDSS-dominated shells. The direction and amplitude of the dipole depend on whether the observed radial recessional velocities are corrected for peculiar velocities or not. If the correction is not applied, the dipole aligns with the major gravitational structures in the local universe. If it is applied, a global dipole still seems to be present, but the signal is much weaker and with much lower statistical significance. This decrease in the amplitude of the dipole supports the idea of a differential expansion rate in our universe, but does not clarify whether the origin is astrophysical or cosmological. Finally, we verify that, while this anisotropy could influence local measurements of the Hubble constant, its effect on the large-scale Hubble tension appears to be limited, as the distribution of galaxies hosting SNeIa, both used as calibrators to constrain $H_0$ and in the Hubble-flow, does not show a strong correlation with the dipole signal."}

We find that the fraction of type 1 AGN hosts with tidal features ($f_T$) is higher for AGNs with higher luminosities and (to a lesser extent) more massive black holes. Specifically, $f_T$ rapidly increases from $0.05\\pm0.03$ to $0.75\\pm0.13$ as the luminosity of the $[\\mathrm{O\\,{\\scriptstyle III}}]$ $λ$5007 emission line ($L_{[\\mathrm{O\\,{\\scriptstyle III}}]}$), an indicator for bolometric AGN luminosity, increases in the range $10^{39.5}\\lesssim L_{[\\mathrm{O\\,{\\scriptstyle III}}]}/(\\mathrm{erg\\,s}^{-1}) \\lesssim10^{42.5}$.

While the absolute flux calibration for LAMOST quasar spectra from Data Releases 6 to 9 was previously performed using the SDSS/PanSTARRS1 multi-band photometric data, the inherent variability of quasars can affect the flux accuracy. To address this limitation, we recalibrated the LAMOST spectra using (quasi-)simultaneous photometric data from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which has conducted high-cadence sky monitoring since March 2018. Based on the recalibrated single-epoch spectra, we estimated the emission line fluxes, continuum fluxes, and virial black hole masses. These improved spectra facilitate direct comparison with the spectra of common quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), enabling searches for rare quasars, such as changing-look quasars exhibiting the appearance or disappearance of broad emission lines and broad absorption line quasars. The combined dataset of photometry and multi-epoch spectra will enhance the detections of AGN-related transients, such as Bowen fluorescence flares and extreme variability quasars, thereby improving our understanding of quasar variability."}

We investigate observational implications of the proposed HT scenario for PSR J1618-3921 and our ability to constrain the scenario. We model the MSP-Helium White Dwarf binary to be a part of bound point-mass HT, while incorporating the effects due to the quadrupolar interactions between the inner and outer binaries, along with dominant order general relativistic contributions to the periastron precession of the inner binary. If the proposed HT system is indeed undergoing Kozai oscillations at the present epoch, the orbital eccentricity ($e$) would be expected to decrease, while the rate of periastron advance ($\\dotω$) would correspondingly increase, for plausible ranges of the HT parameters. Furthermore, the fractional variations in $e$ are anticipated to be at the level of a few parts in $10^{5}$-a magnitude that is substantially larger than the current measurement precision of $e$. We find that, for this eccentric MSP binary, the HT configurations that minimize the temporal evolution of orbital eccentricity and argument of periastron are mutually incompatible. This indicates that the continued high-precision timing of PSR J1618-3921-when analyzed within the framework introduced here-should place stringent limits on the presence and properties of a potential third body in the system."}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "In dense environments, mechanisms like ram pressure stripping (RPS) and gravitational interactions can induce similar morphological features in galaxies, distinguishable only through detailed study of their stellar properties. While RPS affects recently formed stars by displacing the gas disk from which they form, gravitational interactions perturb stars of all ages rather similarly. We present the first observational test of the Size-Shape Difference (SSD) measure, a novel approach validated for simulated galaxies, that quantifies morphological differences between young and intermediate-age stellar populations to distinguish RPS from gravitationally interacting galaxies. We analyze 67 galaxies from the GASP survey using spatially-resolved star formation histories derived using SINOPSIS. In our fiducial model, we compare stellar populations in two age bins (t < 20 Myr and 20 Myr <= t < 570 Myr) to calculate SSD values. The sample includes confirmed RPS cases with different stripping intensities, as well as undisturbed and gravitationally interacting galaxies. We find that extreme cases of RPS show SSD values ~3.5x higher than undisturbed and gravitationally interacting galaxies (56(+24/-15) as compared to 16(+6/-2) and 16(+6/-3), respectively), confirming simulation predictions. This enhancement reflects RPS-induced asymmetries: youngest stars are compressed along the leading edge and/or displaced into the extended tails of cold gas, while older populations remain undisturbed. In contrast, gravitational interactions perturb all stars uniformly, producing lower SSD values. SSD robustly distinguishes strong RPS cases, even adopting different age bins. This holds even without correcting for disk inclination, or when single-band imaging are used to trace stellar distributions. This makes SSD a promising tool to select RPS candidates for spectroscopic follow-up in upcoming surveys."}

As the light from a distant quasar travels towards an observer, it may interact with the circumgalactic medium environment of an intervening galaxy, forming absorption lines. In order to maximize the signal of these absorption lines, we have selected a sample of 238,838 quasar spectra from the second data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), each identified to have absorption lines resulting from such an interaction. By stacking these spectra in the restframe of the absorption, and calculating a median composite spectrum, we are able to isolate and enhance these absorption lines.

Here, we analyse its SED combining new MIRI imaging data with archival NIRSpec/Prism and MRS spectroscopy, and NIRCam imaging. The continuum emission shows a flat energy distribution, in f$_ν$, up to 0.5$μ$m, compatible with the presence of a mixed stellar population of young (4$\\pm$1 Myr) and mature (63$\\pm$23 Myr) stars that also account for the [O III], H$β$ and H$α$ emission lines.

This excess increases to 91$\\pm$28% at rest-frame 0.86$μ$m, although with a large uncertainty due to the marginal detection in the F1000W filter. We consider that hot dust emission in the dusty torus around a type 2 AGN could be responsible for the observed excess. Alternatively, this excess could be due to hot dust emission or to a photoluminiscence dust process (Extended Red Emission, ERE) under the extreme UV radiation field, as observed in some local metal-poor galaxies and in young compact starbursts. The presence of a type 1 AGN is not supported by the observed SED since high-z QSOs contribute at wavelengths above rest-frame 1$μ$m, and an additional ad-hoc red source would be required to explain the observed flux excess at 0.66 and 0.86$μ$m. Additional deep MIRI imaging covering the rest-frame near-IR are needed to confirm the flux detection at 10$μ$m with higher significance, and to discriminate between the different hot dust emission in the extreme starburst and AGN scenarios with MIRI imaging at longer wavelengths."}
