To address this question, we adopt a statistical\napproach and consider a large number of parameterised EOSs that satisfy all\nknown constraints from nuclear theory, perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics\n(QCD), and astrophysical observations. Next, we conjecture that, for any given\nEOS, the maximum compactness is attained by the star with the maximum mass of\nthe sequence of nonrotating configurations. While we can prove this conjecture\nfor a rather large class of solutions, its general proof is still lacking.\nHowever, the evidence from all of the EOSs considered strongly indicates that\nit is true in general. Exploiting the conjecture, we can concentrate on the\ncompactness of the maximum-mass stars and show that an upper limit appears for\nthe maximum compactness and is given by $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm max} = 1/3$.\nImportantly, this upper limit is essentially independent of the stellar mass\nand a direct consequence of perturbative-QCD constraints."}

This feature\ngives rise to the MTI when the temperature gradient is aligned with the\ngravity, which occurs in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. Most previous linear\nanalyses of the MTI adopted a local, Boussinesq approach. However, the\nconduction length, which sets the characteristic length scale of the MTI, might\nbe a non-negligible fraction of the scale height in the ICM. We want to assess\nthe impact of locality assumptions on the linear physics of the MTI. Another\ngoal is to unveil the deeper connections between these global MTI modes and\ntheir MRI counterparts in accretion discs. Our third objective is to provide a\nnew benchmark against which any numerical code implementing the Braginskii heat\nflux in spherical geometry can be tested. We perform a global linear analysis\nof the MTI in a spherical stratified model of the ICM. We use a combination of\nanalytical results, corroborated by numerical results obtained with both a\npseudo-spectral solver and IDEFIX, to better explain the physics of the global\nMTI modes. We obtain scaling laws and approximate expressions for the growth\nrates of the global modes. We show that the associated functions are confined\nwithin an inner region, limited by a turning point, where the mode is allowed\nto grow. The most unstable local MTI modes correspond to the portion of the\nglobal mode localised near the turning point. This phenomenology is similar to\nthat of the global MRI modes. Finally, direct simulations successfully\nreproduce the global MTI modes and their growth rates, with errors smaller than\n1%. Overall, this study provides us with new insights on the linear theory of\nthe global MTI in the ICM, and a useful numerical test bench for any\nastrophysical fluid dynamics code embedding anisotropic heat flux."}

Measurements of Lyman-alpha-transmission and\nLyman-alpha velocity offset along multiple sightlines map the Lyman-alpha\ndamping wing optical depth across the galaxy overdensity. In the standard\ncontext of inside-out ionization, we estimate radii of ionized bubbles (R(min)\n= 0.07 - 0.69 Mpc) based on the distance from each LAE to the first neutral\npatch along the sightline. The resulting 3D topology reveals three distinct\nsub-clusters where the ionized bubbles are approaching overlap. Five of the\nnine LAEs plausibly ionized their bubbles, a few bursts of star formation and a\nmodest escape fraction are sufficient. We demonstrate, however, that the actual\nionized volumes are likely larger, at least R(ism) = 0.42 - 1.29 Mpc, based on\nan empirical model for interstellar attenuation of Lyman-alpha. Modeling\ngalactic attenuation of Lyman-alpha significantly increases the inferred\nintergalactic transmission (thus enlarging the ionized pathlength).

While the\nwidely accepted swing-amplification theory provides a qualitative framework for\ntheir formation, the detailed physical processes remain incompletely\nunderstood. Previous studies have shown that the bar formation timescale in\nisolated galaxies depends exponentially on the disk mass fraction (the\nso-called \"Fujii relation\") and linearly on disk hotness and thickness.\nHowever, the influence of dark matter halo spin on bar formation has not been\nsystematically investigated. In this work, we construct a suite of $N$-body\nmodels of disk and halo with varying disk mass fractions and amounts of random\nmotions. By introducing prograde and retrograde spins in the dark matter halo,\nwe explore how halo spin modifies the established empirical relations governing\nbar formation timescales. We find that these relations remain valid in both\nprograde and retrograde halo spin models. For rapid bar formation (short\ntimescale), the effect of halo spin is nearly negligible. In contrast, for\nmoderately slow bar formation, prograde (retrograde) halo spin tends to\naccelerate (suppress) bar onset. In cases of extremely slow bar formation, halo\nspin introduces a stronger but more stochastic influence.

Measurements of Lyman-alpha-transmission and\nLyman-alpha velocity offset along multiple sightlines map the Lyman-alpha\ndamping wing optical depth across the galaxy overdensity. In the standard\ncontext of inside-out ionization, we estimate radii of ionized bubbles (R(min)\n= 0.07 - 0.69 Mpc) based on the distance from each LAE to the first neutral\npatch along the sightline. The resulting 3D topology reveals three distinct\nsub-clusters where the ionized bubbles are approaching overlap. Five of the\nnine LAEs plausibly ionized their bubbles, a few bursts of star formation and a\nmodest escape fraction are sufficient.

Further, if they are\nindeed sources of extragalactic fields, then there is a possibility that\nobservations of extragalactic magnetic fields could provide insights into the\nprimordial physics. With this motivation, we study the generation of the\nprimordial magnetic field in the context of loop quantum cosmology (LQC). In\nLQC, inflation is preceded by a quantum bounce. In this work, we consider an\nelectromagnetic field coupled to the background as a test field and study its\nevolution through the bounce and through the subsequent inflationary phase. We\ninvestigate the power spectra generated in LQC and show that it is\nscale-dependent. We study the power spectra with different initial conditions,\ndiscuss equivalent forms of coupling functions, investigate backreaction, and\ncompute the amount of primordial magnetic field which can be measured today. We\nconclude the article with a summary and discussion of the results."}
