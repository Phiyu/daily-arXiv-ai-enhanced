We first derive the perturbative expansion around General Relativity (GR), working to first order in the small parameter $α$. For a collapsing flat FLRW dust interior we compute the explicit first-order corrections to the scale factor, the stellar radius, and the horizon formation time. We then use these results to obtain the shift in the PBH formation threshold $δ_c$. The perturbative effect is small for PBHs forming in the deep radiation era, but becomes important when the background curvature is high. To access this early regime we reformulate the theory in the Einstein frame, where the model becomes GR plus the scalaron field $φ$ with the Starobinsky potential. We provide the complete ODE system governing both the cosmological background and the evolution of an overdense closed FLRW patch. This system can be numerically integrated to obtain the critical overdensity $δ_c(k)$ for PBH formation near the end of inflation."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Stellar-mass binaries evolving in the vicinity of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may be common in the universe, either in active galactic nuclei or in other astrophysical environments. Here, we study in detail the resonant excitation of SMBH modes driven by a nearby stellar-mass binary. The resulting resonant energy fluxes vary with the orbital location and frequency of the binary, exhibiting a rich and complex structure. In particular, we find that the total energy flux radiated to infinity is maximized at a gravitational-wave frequency that is close to, but not exactly equal to, the real part of the corresponding quasinormal-mode frequency. Moreover, as the binary is moved farther away from the SMBH, this offset from the mode frequency becomes increasingly pronounced. In addition, for suitable orientations, the binary can effectively ``feed'' the light ring of the SMBH, selectively exciting particular oscillation modes. For rotating (Kerr) black holes, the mode spectrum is significantly more intricate; however, individual modes are also less strongly damped, leading to an enhanced - but more difficult to interpret - resonant response."}

We show that this fundamental obstacle can be overcome by harnessing multi-detector quantum interference. By preparing a system of three entangled Unruh--DeWitt detectors in a specific W-state, the spontaneous emission channels can be forced to destructively interfere and vanish, thereby \"saving\" the Unruh signal by coherently silencing this dominant noise. Our central result is the derivation of the condition for complete and simultaneous cancellation of all right- and left-traveling emission modes. We find this requires preparing the detectors in a unique entangled state whose real-valued coefficients are fixed by an elegant geometric constraint, given by a ratio of sines of the logarithms of the detector accelerations. This work establishes multi-detector entanglement as a precision tool for noise cancellation in relativistic quantum settings, offering a new pathway toward the definitive observation of the Unruh signal."}

Recently, a million-solar-mass object was discovered superposed on an extended and extremely thin gravitational arc. Here we report on extensive tests of various assumptions for the mass density profile and redshift of this object. We find models that best describe the data have two components: an unresolved point-mass of radius $\\leq10$ pc centred on an extended mass distribution with an almost constant surface density out to a truncation radius of 139 pc. These properties do not resemble any known astronomical object. However, if the object is dark matter-dominated, its structure is incompatible with cold dark matter models, but may be compatible with a self-interacting dark matter halo where the central region has collapsed to form a black hole. This detection could thus carry substantial implications for our current understanding of dark matter."}

Therefore, abnormally loud triggers that are not time-coincident can be vetoed. We implement the veto technique in a matched-filter search for transient signals from binary black holes and observe search backgrounds to be generally close to the Gaussian limit. An improvement in the sensitivity of the search is demonstrated using simulated signals.

Using cosmological simulations, we investigate an overdense cosmic region, where star formation and subsequent PISNe occur at $z\\sim30-40$, even within standard cosmology. Assessing the likelihood of such a region, the corresponding number of PISNe at $z\\gtrsim20$, and their observed flux, we find that JWST has a non-negligible chance to detect a PISN event at extremely high redshifts.

Recent advances in imaging and shear estimation have pushed reliable reduced shear measurements closer to cluster cores, making mass reconstruction accessible in the nonlinear regime. However, the Kaiser-Squires based algorithm becomes unstable in cluster cores, where convergence $κ$ significantly deviates from zero and the linear approximation breaks down. To address this limitation, we develop a reconstruction framework with two key modifications: applying smooth masks to these regions and using a model-derived analytical solution as the initial guess, rather than assuming $κ= 0$. We validate our framework using simulated cluster lensing data with known mass distributions, incorporating realistic masks that arise from limitations in reduced shear measurements. We show that in the absence of shape noise, our framework yields high-fidelity mass reconstruction in regions of large reduced shear, with the best-performing method achieving residuals below $0.02 σ$ in the unmasked regions.

Cosmic rays and magnetic fields play an important role for the formation and evolution of galaxies. Radio continuum observations allows us to study them in the haloes of edge-on galaxies. Aims. We explore the frequency dependence of the radio scale height which depends on cosmic ray transport and electron cooling. We test the influence of fundamental galaxy properties, such as star-formation rate (SFR), mass and size. Methods. We used radio continuum data of 16 edge-on galaxies from the Continuum HAloes in Nearby Galaxies - an EVLA Survey (CHANG-ES). We included maps from the LOw Frequency ARray at 144 MHz and from the Jansky Very Large Array at 3 GHz with 7\" angular resolution. We extracted vertical intensity profiles within the effective radio radius and fitted beam-convolved double- exponential models to separate thin and thick discs. For the thick radio discs, we computed mean spectral indices and scale-height ratios between 144 MHz and 3 GHz. Results. We find a mean scale-height ratio of 1.26 \\pm 0.16. This is much lower than what we would expect for either cosmic ray diffusion or advection if synchrotron and inverse Compton losses dominate for the electrons. There is a moderate positive correlation between the ratio and spectral index of the thick disc: galaxies with high ratios have flat radio spectra. The ratio does not depend on any other galaxy parameter. The radio spectrum of the thick disc, as indicated by the radio spectral index, steepens with total mass (strong correlation) and flattens with SFR-to-mass surface density (moderate correlation). Conclusions. Galaxies with galactic winds have flat radio continuum spectra and large scale heights at low frequencies. This shows effective transport of cosmic rays in such systems."}

The model is constructed using an analytical closed-form solution to Einstein's field equations. Assuming a characteristic density of $ρ_{a}= 2\\times10^{14} \\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-3}}$, we compute the total mass and radius of the star based on a prescribed set of structural parameters that influence the density profile. The resulting stellar configurations exhibit boundary radii and total masses comparable to those of neutron stars with vanishing charge density.\n  New exact solutions are obtained by solving the relevant second-order ordinary differential equations. We demonstrate that these solutions satisfy the standard energy conditions and maintain hydrostatic equilibrium throughout the stellar interior. All physical requirements remain valid at every point within the configuration. In this framework, the parameter $λ=\\frac{ρ_{a}}{ρ_{0}}$ serves as a key determinant of the mass--radius relationship. We further assess the suitability of the model for representing a relativistic superdense star and analyze its stability under radial perturbations. The investigation indicates that, for the configuration to remain dynamically stable, the density ratio between the outer and inner regions must take the value $λ= 0.4$."}

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "We propose an innovative definition of the scale at which the Universe becomes homogeneous based on measurements of velocities rather than densities. When using the matter density field, one has to choose an arbitrary scale (e.g. within 1\\% of the average density) to define the transition to homogeneity. Furthermore, the resulting homogeneity scale is strongly degenerate with the galaxy bias. By contrast, peculiar velocities (PV) allow us to define an unambiguous scale of homogeneity, namely the distance at which the velocities between pairs of galaxies change from being on-average correlated to anti-correlated. Physically, this relates to when the motion of pairs of galaxies is influenced by the matter density between them, rather than beyond. The disadvantage is that peculiar velocities are more difficult to measure than positions, resulting in smaller samples with larger uncertainties. Nevertheless, we illustrate the potential of this approach using the peculiar velocity correlation functions obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey PV catalog, finding an homogeneity scale of $R_H\\approx 133\\substack{+28 \\\\ -52}\\, \\rm{Mpc/h}$. Finally, we show that more precise measurements are within reach of upcoming peculiar velocity surveys, and highlight this homogeneity scale's potential use as a standard ruler within the standard cosmological model."}

At the same time, stellar kinematics from Gaia have uncovered ridge-like features in the velocity space, raising the question of whether these chemical and dynamical substructures share a common origin. Using a sample of disk stars from Gaia DR3, we find that azimuthal metallicity variations are correlated with kinematic ridges in the V_phi-R plane, suggesting a shared origin. We utilize a suite of Milky Way test-particle simulations to assess the role of transient spiral arms, the bar, and interactions with a Sagittarius-like dwarf galaxy in simultaneously shaping both chemical and kinematic substructures. Among the physical mechanisms explored, bar and spiral arm interactions are the ones that consistently reproduce both the chemo-kinematic features and alignment observed in the Gaia data. While our model of an interaction with a Sagittarius-like dwarf galaxy can also induce kinematic and metallicity substructure, the amplitude of the azimuthal metallicity variations are too weak, suggesting this is likely not the dominant influence. Although additional contributing processes cannot be ruled out, the azimuthal metallicity variations observed in Gaia are best explained by a dynamical origin. Our results support the view that that azimuthal metallicity variations in the Galaxy are driven by similar dynamical mechanisms responsible for generating the kinematic ridges and co-moving groups."}

This serves as an accurate alternative to the more computationally demanding bare estimator that uses all baselines and frequency channels. Further, we employ a non-parametric foreground-subtraction method based on Gaussian process regression, which minimizes loss of the HI 21-cm signal and yields improved signal-to-noise ratios.

Finally, we apply a Bayesian likelihood framework with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to the residual visibilities to recover ionized bubble properties, including radius, position, and the mean neutral fraction. The resulting posterior distributions demonstrate accurate recovery of the bubble parameters. This confirms the feasibility of robustly characterizing individual ionized regions with the SKA1-Low."}

For this purpose, hydrodynamic simulations were performed using the GADGET-4 code, with initial conditions generated by the Galstep and SnapshotJoiner programs. Systems of two galaxies on a head-on collision course were modeled with relative initial velocities ranging from 100 km/s to 1000 km/s, considering two scenarios: the first with identical galaxies, and the second with galaxies of different sizes. In simulations of systems with higher initial relative velocities, both found more intense peaks in the star formation rate, triggered by the first contact of the collision, followed by a strong decline caused by gas dispersion. In contrast, for systems with lower initial velocities, mergers between galaxies were observed, leading to multiple peaks in the star formation rate. A greater initial distance between galaxies has also been linked to whether or not the galaxy system merges, since it implies longer timescales for gravitational action, which leads to higher relative velocities at the moment of collision. Furthermore, the star formation rate in galaxies was found to have a clear dependence on initial gas content. Furthermore, the initial gas content in galaxies was found to have a clear dependence on star formation rates. Overall, our results show that the relative impact velocity, the initial distance between the galaxies, and the gas content are important parameters for analyzing the star formation rate in colliding galaxies."}

This result uncovers a previously unexplored phenomenon, namely the ``complete freezing of initially maximal entanglement\" under relativistic motion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first identification and systematic characterization of such a phenomenon within a relativistic framework. These findings overturn the conventional view that acceleration universally diminishes maximal entanglement and establish the $CL_4$ state as a promising resource for quantum information processing in non-inertial or curved-spacetime settings."}

We examine patterns in [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] in FIRE-2 simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies. Out of 16 galaxies, 4 are capable of producing a strongly bimodal distribution. In all four galaxies, the high-$α$ population corresponds to an older, radially-compact, thick disk, and the low-$α$ population corresponds to a younger, radially-extended, thin disk, similar to the MW.The transition from high- to low-$α$ took $0.3-1.2\\Gyr$ and began $5.5-6.5\\Gyr$ ago. [Mg/Fe] decreased at relatively fixed [Fe/H], both in the galaxy overall and at fixed radii: Fe enrichment nearly balanced gas accretion (and therefore dilution), but Mg enrichment was weaker. Importantly, this transition occurred during a period of relatively low gas fraction ($5-15\\%$), immediately after a rapid decline in star formation (halving within a few hundred Myr), which caused an increase in Fe-producing white-dwarf supernovae relative to Mg-producing core-collapse supernovae. Only one case coincided with a major merger coalescence. We find similar trends in measuring stars by their current radius and by their birth radius, therefore, radial redistribution did not play a dominant role in the formation of a bimodality or its spatial dependence today. Overall, in FIRE-2, strong $α$-element bimodalities are relatively uncommon ($\\sim25\\%$), often not associated with a major merger, and arise primarily from a rapid decline in star formation during relatively low gas fraction."}

Using the rigging technique, we first define a local frame adapted to these slices and reconstruct the geometry and dynamics fully. We clarify the connection of the frame adapted to constant-radius slices, to the Kodama vector and Misner-Sharp energy. Through frame transformations, we then show that the gravitational dynamics in a general foliation-adapted frame can be interpreted as hydrodynamics, i.e., geometro-hydrodynamics: the Einstein equations exhibit the gravitational analogs of the Euler and Young-Laplace equations, and the spacetime can be viewed as the worldvolume of a concentric stack of \"gravitational bubbles\" -- spherical collective modes with the Misner-Sharp energy density and a geometric pressure. We apply this framework to apparent horizons and study the dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate that a similar geometro-hydrodynamic picture holds in Lovelock gravity. These results provide a fresh perspective on this class of spacetimes and lay the foundation for understanding their thermodynamic properties."}

By removing angular momentum, shocks in gas cause inflows, which can trigger nuclear star formation and fuel AGN activity. To identify the signatures of extended shocks, we examine residual velocity fields after subtracting a modelled rotating disc, and we study velocity difference between various gas tracers. Combining our kinematic analysis with BPT ionisation diagnostic maps and dust morphology, we find that 11 of 21 galaxies ($\\sim$52%) show extended shock signatures with velocity jumps consistent with models of bar-driven shocks. This is likely a lower limit, as three additional galaxies ($\\sim$15%) exhibit shocks along bars, potentially reaching the nucleus but obscured by AGN outflows.

The only two unbarred galaxies in our sample are also the only systems with unperturbed kinematics and no shocks, strongly linking the perturbed gas dynamics in centres of galaxies to the presence of bars. All galaxies with inner bars show LINER- or Seyfert-like nuclear emission, whereas galaxies without inner bars exhibit all emission types, indicating that regardless of gas supply, inner bars suppress star formation in galactic nuclei."}

This motivates cross-correlations, to ascertain the cosmological nature of measured HI fluctuations, and to study their connections with galaxies and the underlying matter density field. However, these same foregrounds render the cross-correlation with projected fields such as the lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) difficult. Indeed, the correlated Fourier modes vary slowly along the line of sight, and are thus most contaminated by the smooth-spectrum radio continuum foregrounds. In this paper, we implement a method that avoids this issue by attempting to measure the non-linear gravitational coupling of the small-scale 21cm power from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) with large-scale Planck CMB lensing. This measurement is a position-dependent power spectrum, i.e. a squeezed integrated bispectrum. Using 94 nights of CHIME data between $1.0 < z < 1.3$ and aggressive foreground filtering, we find that the expected signal is five times smaller than the current noise. We forecast that incorporating the additional nights of CHIME data already collected would enable a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, without any further improvements in filtering for foreground cleaning."}

We classify the absorption systems based on whether they display only low-ionization absorption (CII, SiII, MgII), only high-ionization absorption (CIV, SiIV), or both. The percentage of low-ionization-only systems decreases from 24% at $z\\sim$6 to 2% at $z\\sim$4.3, whilst the fraction of high-ionization-only systems increases from 52% to 82%. For mixed absorbers (with both low and high ionization absorption), we use the column density ratios log(N_CII/N_CIV) and log(N_SiII/N_SiIV) to quantify the average ionization as a function of redshift. The log(N_SiII/N_SiIV) ratio does not change significantly over 5$\\lesssim z \\lesssim$6.3. We combine the E-XQR-30 log(N_CII/N_CIV) measurements with literature measurements at $z\\sim$2-4 and find that the log(N_CII/N_CIV) ratio declines by a factor of $\\sim$20 between $z\\sim$6 and $z\\sim$2. To explore possible drivers of this evolution, we run photoionization models of gas slabs illuminated by a uniform UV background at fixed density, metallicity and HI column density. We find that the increase in the ionization state of metal absorbers towards lower redshifts can likely be explained by some combination of 1) an increase in the metallicity of CIV-absorbing gas and 2) a decrease in the typical HI column densities of the absorbing gas, driven by the declining cosmic mean density and a rapid rise in the strength of the UV background during the final stages of reionization."}

For this, we have estimated the Hubble parameter, the effective equation of state parameter ($ω^{eff}$), and the potential of the scalar field as a function of time using equation $H = W(ψ)$. The graphical representation of the potential function $V(ψ)$ with respect to cosmic time t is described. This study explores the dynamical properties of a Bianchi Type-I universe by utilizing Bayesian statistical techniques to constrain the model parameters and evaluate the viability of anisotropic cosmology under extended matter-geometry couplings. Also, we have applied the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) mechanism on the derived $H(z)$ model by using observational Hubble data (OHD), the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) dataset, and the Pantheon dataset. From the confidence-level contours and best-fit parameter values obtained, along with the corresponding reduced $χ^{2}$, it is evident that the model aligns strongly with observational data, demonstrating statistical stability and consistency in describing late-time cosmic acceleration. Likewise, the error analyses presented in this research, including a comparison between the $Λ$CDM cosmology and the reconstructed $H(z)$ model, confirm the model's compatibility with current observations by yielding a reliable and accurate account of the universe's expansion history."}

This milestone represents a major advancement for GW cosmology, as many methods, particularly those employing the spectral siren approach, critically depend on the number of available sources. We investigate the impact of a novel parametric model describing the full population mass spectrum of CBCs on the estimation of the Hubble constant. This model is designed to test the impact of heavy black holes in GW cosmology. We perform a joint inference of cosmological and population parameters using 142 CBCs from GWTC-4.0 with a false alarm rate smaller than 0.25 per year, using both spectral and dark siren approaches. With spectral sirens, we estimate the Hubble constant to be $H_0 = 78.8^{+19.0}_{-15.3}\\,{\\rm km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ (68% CL), while the dark siren method yields $H_0 = 82.5^{+16.8}_{-14.3}\\,{\\rm km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ (68% CL). These results improve the uncertainty by approximately 30.4% and 36.2%, respectively. We show that this improvement is linked to the presence of a new mass scale in the binary black hole mass spectrum at $63.3^{+4.8}_{-4.8}\\,M_{\\odot}$, which provides additional constraints on the Hubble constant. Besides providing the tightest standard-siren constraints on $H_0$, this highlights the importance of a heavy-mass feature in the black hole spectrum."}

However, the physical mechanisms governing subhalo spin acquisition within the tidal environments of host halos remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the alignment between subhalo and host halo spins using the high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulation, Shin-Uchuu. We find that the spin alignment between subhalos and host halos becomes increasingly pronounced toward the central regions. Our analysis reveals that subhalos typically acquire spin in the same direction as their orbital angular momentum. Since the orbital angular momentum of most subhalos is aligned with the host halo spin, an overall alignment between subhalo and host spins emerges. When classified by orbital orientation, however, subhalo spins in the inner regions are found to be oriented perpendicularly or anti-parallel to the host spin for polar and retrograde orbits, respectively. These results provide strong evidence that subhalo spins are acquired through torques exerted by the tidal field of the host halo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mass ratio and the radial distance from the host center are the primary parameters governing subhalo spin alignment, while the dependence on the accretion redshift is found to be negligible."}

For a collapsing flat FLRW dust interior we compute the explicit first-order corrections to the scale factor, the stellar radius, and the horizon formation time. We then use these results to obtain the shift in the PBH formation threshold $δ_c$. The perturbative effect is small for PBHs forming in the deep radiation era, but becomes important when the background curvature is high. To access this early regime we reformulate the theory in the Einstein frame, where the model becomes GR plus the scalaron field $φ$ with the Starobinsky potential. We provide the complete ODE system governing both the cosmological background and the evolution of an overdense closed FLRW patch. This system can be numerically integrated to obtain the critical overdensity $δ_c(k)$ for PBH formation near the end of inflation."}

Although early studies typically adopted a single-disk model, we detect two distinct components at Galactocentric distances of 5-14 kpc, enabled by photometric, spectroscopic, and astrometric measurements of over 5 million stars. The thin dust disk's scale height increases radially from 60 to 200 pc, while the thick disk grows from 300 to 800 pc. For the first time, we find the thin and thick dust disk correlates spatially with molecular and atomic hydrogen disk, respectively. The thin, thick, and combined disks have scale lengths of 9.6+1.2-1.1 kpc, 4.2+0.4-0.3 kpc, and 6.6+0.3-0.3 kpc, respectively.

We critically assess this consistency argument using scalar field models. We show that whether complementarity or no-signalling is violated when quantum fluctuations are neglected, depends on how this approximation is taken, while in both cases entanglement is generated locally in spacetime. We clarify that the correct reading of the paradox requires making a clear distinction between two notions of causality violation: Newtonian action-at-a-distance and the quantum mechanical no-signalling; the latter is pertinent while the former is not. We conclude that the thought experiment (a) does not add to the epistemological relevance of entanglement through Newtonian potentials (b) lends support for the existence of gravitons, if retardation effects are detected in entanglement through gravity."}

We assess shadow detectability for 31 SMBH with predicted large angular sizes, exploring different telescope location and antenna size.

When using the matter density field, one has to choose an arbitrary scale (e.g. within 1\\% of the average density) to define the transition to homogeneity. Furthermore, the resulting homogeneity scale is strongly degenerate with the galaxy bias. By contrast, peculiar velocities (PV) allow us to define an unambiguous scale of homogeneity, namely the distance at which the velocities between pairs of galaxies change from being on-average correlated to anti-correlated. Physically, this relates to when the motion of pairs of galaxies is influenced by the matter density between them, rather than beyond. The disadvantage is that peculiar velocities are more difficult to measure than positions, resulting in smaller samples with larger uncertainties. Nevertheless, we illustrate the potential of this approach using the peculiar velocity correlation functions obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey PV catalog, finding an homogeneity scale of $R_H\\approx 133\\substack{+28 \\\\ -52}\\, \\rm{Mpc/h}$.

In four galaxies (ESO 428-G14, NGC 4388, NGC 3081, and NGC 5728), we detect spatially resolved dust structures extending ~100-200 pc along the NLR. In these systems, we find a strong link between the morphology of the dust, the radio ejecta, and the coronal [Si VI] emission, implying that dust carries imprints of the processes shaping the NLR. Using spatially resolved spectral energy distributions, we show that dust in the NLR has systematically steeper slopes than star forming clumps. This dust emits at temperatures in the range 150 - 220 K, at a distance of ~150 pc from the nucleus. Using simple models, we show that, even under optimistic assumptions of grain size and AGN luminosity, the excess MIR emission cannot be explained by AGN illumination alone. We interpret this excess heating as in-situ. We show that shocks with velocities of $v_{\\rm shock} \\sim 200- 400 \\, \\rm km/s$ in dense gas can close this gap, and in some cases even account for the total observed emission. This, combined with multiple lines of evidence for shocks in these regions, supports a scenario in which shocks not only coexist with dust but may be playing a key role in heating it. Our findings reveal shocks may be an important and previously overlooked driver of extended dust emission in the central hundreds of parsecs in AGN."}

All comments are welcome", "summary": "Recently, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2) suggests that the dark energy in our universe might be evolving, favoring the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization and a lower Hubble constant. In our previous work, it has been reported that cosmological model with the non-singular bounce inflation (BI) scenario and $Λ$CDM might alleviate the Hubble tension into 3$σ$ confidence. In this paper, we study the cosmological model of BI with a dynamical dark energy. We find that individual consideration of the CPL parameterization and the data \\texttt{DESI DR2} tend to larger Hubble constants for both BI and power law (PL) case with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. Employing BI with combined CPL parameterization and \\texttt{DESI DR2}, we obtain the Hubble constant $H_ 0 = 65.2^{ + 1.8}_{ - 2.2} \\ \\mathrm{km} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{ -1 } \\cdot \\mathrm{Mpc}^{ -1 }$, which is larger than $H_ 0 = 64.0 \\pm 2.1 \\ \\mathrm{km} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{ -1 } \\cdot \\mathrm{Mpc}^{ -1 }$ for the PL case. After considering nontrivial weak lensing effect and spatial curvature as well as adding \\texttt{Pantheon+}, BI fits 3.1$σ$ confidence of $Λ$CDM with $w_ 0 = -0.919 \\pm 0.038$ and $w_{ \\mathrm{a}} = -0.37 \\pm 0.12$, and it prefers evolving dark energy than the PL case with $w_ 0 = -0.960 \\pm 0.074$ and $w_{ \\mathrm{a}} = -0.15^{ +0.28}_{ -0.25}$."}

Rubin Observatory Data Preview 1 (DP1), we present the detection and photometric analysis of a stellar stream extending along the minor axis of a massive disk-galaxy, LEDA 751050, at a redshift of z = 0.1 in the Extended Chandra Deep Field-South (ECDFS). This feature appears to be an analog of the M31 Giant Stellar Stream, spanning around 130 kpc by 15 kpc, with an estimated stellar mass of M_* = 6x10^8 M_Sun, and a mean g-band surface brightness (SB) of mu_g = 28.6 mag/arcsec^2. This discovery demonstrates Rubin's ability to reveal low-SB substructures and foreshadows the future capabilities when the full Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) data set is actualized."}

This milestone represents a major advancement for GW cosmology, as many methods, particularly those employing the spectral siren approach, critically depend on the number of available sources. We investigate the impact of a novel parametric model describing the full population mass spectrum of CBCs on the estimation of the Hubble constant. This model is designed to test the impact of heavy black holes in GW cosmology. We perform a joint inference of cosmological and population parameters using 142 CBCs from GWTC-4.0 with a false alarm rate smaller than 0.25 per year, using both spectral and dark siren approaches. With spectral sirens, we estimate the Hubble constant to be $H_0 = 78.8^{+19.0}_{-15.3}\\,{\\rm km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ (68% CL), while the dark siren method yields $H_0 = 82.5^{+16.8}_{-14.3}\\,{\\rm km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ (68% CL). These results improve the uncertainty by approximately 30.4% and 36.2%, respectively. We show that this improvement is linked to the presence of a new mass scale in the binary black hole mass spectrum at $63.3^{+4.8}_{-4.8}\\,M_{\\odot}$, which provides additional constraints on the Hubble constant. Besides providing the tightest standard-siren constraints on $H_0$, this highlights the importance of a heavy-mass feature in the black hole spectrum."}
