We reveal that in environments with higher external\ndensity, enhanced mass inflow from the envelope leads to Bondi-like accretion\nas the protostellar mass increases. The continued inflow substantially\nincreases the final stellar mass, resulting in star formation efficiencies that\nappear to exceed unity in dense environments. The external medium also\ninfluences the evolution of circumstellar disks and protostellar outflows: with\nthe high-density external medium, disks grow rapidly but their mass becomes\nsmaller relative to the protostellar mass, and the outflow is sustained over a\nlong duration.

Comments welcome!", "summary": "Observations of $\\gamma$-rays from diffuse gas provide the opportunity to\nstudy the distribution of high energy particles in different astrophysical\nenvironments. In the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the intracluster medium\n(ICM), it is expected that relativistic cosmic rays collide with thermal\nparticles and produce $\\gamma$-rays through pion decay. The $\\gamma$-ray\nluminosity of a plasma depends on where cosmic rays are: if they are in denser\ngas, they produce more $\\gamma$-rays. In this work, we study how different\ncosmic-ray transport mechanisms impact the $\\gamma$-ray luminosity of a\nturbulent, multiphase medium formed from an initially diffuse medium. Two\nquantities set the luminosity: the average cosmic-ray energy density and the\ncorrelation of cosmic-ray energy and gas density. Overall, cosmic rays must\nescape cold dense regions in order to produce less $\\gamma$-ray emission and be\nconsistent with observations. Our simulations with fast transport mechanisms\n(either diffusion or streaming) are degenerate: they each produce a lower\n$\\gamma$-ray luminosity than slow transport simulations by two orders of\nmagnitude. This result means that fast transport (particularly in dense clumps)\nis necessary for simulations to agree with the dearth of observations of\n$\\gamma$-ray emission from diffuse gas like the CGM and ICM. We also show the\nsignificant difference in luminosity is the result of cosmic-ray\nreacceleration. This reacceleration is different from the turbulent\nreacceleration described by Ptuskin (1988). Instead, condensing, cold clouds\ndrive a significant increase in the average cosmic-ray energy and, as a result,\nthe $\\gamma$-ray luminosity."}

Analytic models to describe this evolution have been\ndeveloped and calibrated to numerical simulations initialized with isotropic\nparticle velocity distributions, an assumption not necessarily warranted by the\ntheory of halo formation. Here we study the dependence of the timescale for\ngravothermal collapse on the velocity distribution. To do so, we consider\nself-consistent initial conditions for halos with the same density distribution\nbut with different velocity distributions. We consider models with constant\nanisotropy and with an anisotropy that increases with radius. The velocity\ndistributions that we explore have collapse times that differ from that\nassuming isotropic distributions by more than a factor of two. We argue that\nthese variations may depend on the global changes in velocity-dispersion\nprofiles in these anisotropic models and not just on the degree of anisotropy."}
