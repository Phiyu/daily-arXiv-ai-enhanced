For a Neptune radius solar system the answer is, rarely. For an Oort cloud sized system the answer is different. Simulations of bombardment of the Oort cloud by dark matter suggest that dislodgement of protocomets and their entry into the inner solar system can match the observed frequency of comets, if that PBH fraction is high enough. Comets were traditionally considered as messengers, usually omens. After 50 years of puzzlement regarding dark matter, we need a hint from the dark universe about the size and nature of dark matter particles."}

Calibration inaccuracies can compromise the spectral fidelity of the smooth foreground continuum, thereby limiting the dynamic range and potentially precluding the detection of the cosmic line signal. In light of this challenge, recent work has proposed using the calibration-independent closure phase to search for the spectral fluctuations of the cosmic 21 cm signal. However, so far there has been only a heuristic understanding of how closure phases map to the cosmological 21 cm power spectrum. This work aims to establish a more accurate mathematical relationship between closure phases and the cosmological power spectrum of the background line signal. Building on previous work, we treat the cosmic signal component as a perturbation to the closure phase and use a delay spectrum approach to estimate its power. We establish the relationship between this estimate and the cosmological power spectrum using standard Fourier transform techniques and validate it using simulated HERA observations. We find that, statistically, the power spectrum estimate from closure phases is approximately equal to the cosmological power spectrum convolved with a foreground-dependent window function, provided that the signal-to-foreground ratio is small. Compared with standard approaches, the foreground dependence of the window function results in an increased amount of mode-mixing and a more pronounced proliferation of foreground power along the line-of-sight dimension of the cylindrical power spectrum. These effects can be mitigated by flagging instances where the window function is broad. Crucial to gaining the necessary sensitivity, this mapping will allow us to average the measurements of closure triads of different shapes based on their imprint in cylindrical Fourier space."}

Our implementation combines this HOD formulation with an IA model, enabling end-to-end automatic differentiation from HOD and IA parameters through to the galaxy field. We additionally extend this framework to differentiably model two-point correlation functions, including galaxy clustering and IA statistics. We validate diffHOD-IA against the reference halotools-IA implementation using the Bolshoi-Planck simulation, demonstrating excellent agreement across both one-point and two-point statistics. We verify the accuracy of gradients computed via automatic differentiation by comparison with finite-difference estimates for both HOD and IA parameters. We present science use cases leveraging gradients in the simulations to recover the IA parameters of a galaxy field representative of the TNG300 simulation.

Galaxy clustering is sensitive to $f_{\\textrm{NL}}$ at large scale modes and the next generation of galaxy surveys will approach a statistical error of $σ_{f_{\\textrm{NL}}}\\sim1$. However, the systematic errors on these constraints are dominated by the degeneracy of $f_{\\textrm{NL}}$ with the galaxy bias parameters $b_1$ (galaxy overdensities caused by mass perturbations) and $b_φ$ (galaxy overdensities caused by primordial potential perturbations). It has been shown that the assumed scaling of $b_φ(z)=2δ_c (b_1(z)-1)$ is not accurate for realistically simulated galaxies, and depends both on the galaxy selection and the way that galaxies are modeled. To address this, we leverage the CAMELS-SAM pipeline to explore how varying parameters of galaxy formation affects $b_φ$ and $b_1$ for various galaxy selections. We run separate-universe N-body simulations of $L=205 h^{-1}$ cMpc and $N=1280^3$ to measure $b_φ$, and run 55 unique instances of the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model with varying parameters of stellar and AGN feedback. We find the behavior and evolution of a SC-SAM model's stellar-, SFR- and sSFR- to halo mass relationships track well with how $b_1$ and $b_φ(b_1)$ change across redshift and selection for the SC-SAM. We find our variations of the SC-SAM encapsulate the $b_φ$ behavior previously measured in IllustrisTNG, the Munich SAM, and Galacticus.Finally, we identify sSFR selections as particularly robust to varied galaxy modeling."}

Semenov"], "title": "How Do Disk Galaxies Form?", "comment": "24 pages, 11 figures; submitted to ApJ; comments are welcome", "summary": "In both observed and simulated galaxies, disk morphologies become more prevalent at higher masses and lower redshifts. To elucidate the physical origin of this trend, we develop a simple analytical model in which galaxy morphology is governed by the competition between rotational support and turbulence in a gravitational potential of a dark matter halo and the galaxy itself, and a disk forms when the potential steepens due to the accumulation of baryons in the halo center. The minimum galaxy mass required for this transition decreases with an increasing dark matter contribution within the galaxy, making more concentrated halos more prone to forming disks. Our model predicts that galaxy sizes behave qualitatively differently before and after disk formation: after disks form, sizes are governed by the halo spin, in agreement with classical models, whereas before disk formation, sizes are larger and set by the scale on which turbulent motions, which dominate over rotation, can be contained. We validate our model against the results of the TNG50 cosmological simulation and, despite the simplicity of the model, find remarkable agreement. In particular, our model explains the increase with redshift in the critical halo mass for disk formation, reported in both simulations and observations, as a consequence of the evolution of the halo mass-concentration and baryonic mass-halo mass relations. This redshift trend therefore supports the recent proposal that it is the steepening of the gravitational potential that causes disk formation, while other effects discussed in the literature, such as potential deepening and hot gaseous halo formation, can still play important roles in the transition from early turbulent to dynamically cold disks."}

After explicitly modelling this with SBI, we use a neural likelihood estimator to find the posterior distribution for CatWISE's dipole, confirming the presence of a dipole twice as large as the CMB expectation but more seriously misaligned with the CMB direction ($\\approx 3 σ$). We also use our learned likelihood to infer the Bayesian evidence, learning that models which increase the scale of CatWISE's photometric errors are most favoured. This is strong evidence that the sample's errors are underestimated or that there is an additional, unresolved systematic producing the same effect as Eddington bias. While our results indicate that the cosmic dipole excess is a persistent issue for $Λ$CDM, we showcase that SBI can untangle the subtle and complex systematic issues affecting any sample derived from real astronomical data."}

While cold dark matter simulations predict cuspy inner density profiles, observations of low surface brightness (LSB) and dwarf galaxies often favour cored profiles, an issue known as the cusp-core problem. We investigate this problem by comparing four dark matter halo profiles: NFW (cuspy), Einasto (intermediate), Burkert (cored), and pseudo-isothermal (pISO) (cored) in a pilot sample of $11$ galaxies from the GMRT archive atomic gas survey (GARCIA). We have performed mass modelling using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, utilising rotation curves derived from robust 3D Kinematic modelling. Baryonic contributions from stars derived using stellar kinematics based on $3.6μ\\mathrm{m}$ or $r$-band photometry via Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE) combined with Jeans Anisotropic Model (JAM) and from gas, calculated directly from the gas surface density (HI + He) without assuming any predefined functional form, are included. Our mass modelling shows that all halo profiles provide statistically good fits, yielding consistent estimates of halo mass and stellar mass-to-light ratio. To validate our analysis, we examine the stellar-to-halo mass relation and find broad agreement with empirical models. Non-parametric density profiles derived from baryon-subtracted rotation curves show that NFW fits the inner regions best, while all profiles converge in the outskirts. Future studies with a larger sample from GARCIA will be helpful in refining this trend and addressing the cusp-core issue in greater depth."}

The tidal interaction is resonantly amplified as the orbital frequency approaches the NS fundamental mode (f-mode) frequency. It has been shown that the exclusion of tidal resonance in parameter estimation leads to a significant bias in the inferred NS tidal deformability and hence the NS EoS [Pratten et al. PRL 129, 081102 (2022)]. The strength and location of tidal resonance depend sensitively on the f-mode frequency, which is typically modeled using its universal relation with the tidal deformability that is derived for an isolated, non-spinning NS assuming only linear fluid perturbations. In a BNS inspiral, the f-mode frequency can be corrected by at least three known effects: nonlinear hydrodynamics, background spin, and relativity. We use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the systematic bias on tidal deformability when each frequency correction is ignored. Our study considers both loud, individual events and the stacking of a population of detections. Both scenarios are expected when the next-generation detectors are available with a sensitivity level increased by about an order of magnitude."}

Recent work has shown that individual galaxy bias (b_i), which quantifies how each galaxy traces the underlying dark matter field, exhibits a characteristic radial dependence within spherical voids, defining a void bias profile in which galaxies near void centers display systematically lower bias values. We investigate how the environmental modulation of individual galaxy bias depends on the adopted void-finding algorithm by comparing measurements across five distinct void definitions: spherical voids 'sparkling', watershed-based methods ('zobov' and 'revolver' in two modes), and free-form integrated-density voids ('popcorn'). We apply these complementary void-finding algorithms to the same galaxy sample drawn from the IllustrisTNG simulation (TNG300-1 at $z=0$) and compute individual galaxy bias profiles as a function of distance from void centers. We quantify the correlation between b_i and the membership of the void catalogs and explore how this relationship varies with the integrated underdensity threshold for density-based methods. We find that the radial gradient of individual bias within voids, generally increasing from negative values at the void centers to higher values at the boundaries, is robust across most void definitions. However, density-threshold methods preferentially select galaxies with b_i<0, while watershed methods without density constraints include substantial contamination from high-bias boundary galaxies. The correlation between negative bias and void membership is systematically strengthened as the integrated underdensity threshold becomes less restrictive, with popcorn achieving the highest purity in isolating anti-biased populations."}

Unlike the Schwarzschild case, two new features can arise in black holes with two horizons: an apparent-horizon left vertex, a temporary minimum in the apparent-horizon radius during collapse, and a bounce, where the star surface stops collapsing at a nonzero radius and reverses into expansion. We identify the conditions that lead to these two features. For two-horizon exteriors, trapped-region consistency requires that the apparent-horizon turning point occurs no earlier than the surface crossing of the inner horizon. As a concrete example, the OS collapse of the Reissner-Nordström (RN) spacetime shows both effects. In contrast, regular black holes with de Sitter cores show neither: their collapse is smooth and monotonic, and the surface approaches the center only as the proper time goes to infinity. These results naturally classify the OS collapses into three categories: singular, which ends at the center in finite time; bouncing, which reverses at a finite radius; and soft-landing, which reaches the center only asymptotically. We argue that these features are consistent with Penrose's strong cosmic censorship conjecture."}

Galaxies are divided between the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and lower-ranked (in brightness) galaxies (non-BCGs) in three rich galaxy clusters within the core of the Shapley super cluster. We find several velocity maps with rich kinematic structure, including multiple spin reversals within the region encompassing central two effective radii, typically associated with BCGs. The majority of BCGs show rotation around the major-axis, at least in one of the visible velocity components. These kinematic structures are possible only if galaxies have non-axisymmetric shapes and contain several orbital families with both prograde and retrograde rotations. There are six fast rotators in the M3G sample, all among non-BCGs, and typically ranked below the 3rd brightest galaxy. Based on the properties of the h3 Gauss-Hermite moment, fast rotation can be linked to the dominance of prograde rotating short-axis tubes in the orbital distribution. Slow rotators are BCGs or the second and sometimes third brightest galaxies, indicating that the galaxy mass (brightness) is not the only driver of low spin, but that the location within the local environment also plays a role. Slow rotators, as evidenced from their multi-spin velocity maps, require more complex orbital structures. Furthermore, some BCGs show kinematic evidence for a secondary component at larger radii, likely not in equilibrium with the main galaxy and possibly made of stars accreted from other cluster galaxies. Multi-spin velocity maps, low angular momentum and additional kinematic components highlight the difference in the evolutionary histories of BCGs (including 2nd ranked galaxies) and non-BCGs."}

Moffat"], "title": "Suppression of Gravitational-Wave Echoes in Diffeomorphism-Invariant Nonlocal Gravity", "comment": null, "summary": "Searches for late--time gravitational--wave echoes following compact binary mergers are often interpreted as probes of exotic near--horizon or horizonless physics. We show that a well--motivated class of ultraviolet--finite quantum gravity and modified gravity theories, those based on diffeomorphism--invariant, analytic, entire--function nonlocality, generically suppress observable echo signals. The suppression follows from Paley--Wiener bounds associated with the analyticity of the nonlocal regulator, which enforce exponential damping of high--frequency reflection amplitudes and smear sharp effective potentials in the black--hole interior. We demonstrate that for regular black holes with horizons, the standard ingoing boundary condition eliminates the cavity required for echoes, while for regular horizonless compact objects the nonlocal kernel strongly attenuates both inner and photon--sphere reflections. As a result, repeated reflections during the ringdown phase are exponentially suppressed in frequency space and washed out in the time domain. Our results imply that the absence of echoes in current gravitational--wave data is consistent with covariant nonlocal gravity theories and does not, by itself, favor classical horizons over regular or horizonless ultraviolet completions. The analyticity and Paley--Wiener bounds that enforce echo suppression are required to ensure unitarity, ghost freedom, and ultraviolet finiteness of the underlying quantum theory. As a result, the classical ringdown phenomenology already encodes quantum--gravity consistency conditions. We emphasize that the absence of echoes in such theories does not rely on quantum decoherence or stochastic effects, but instead reflects the analytic structure imposed by quantum gravity on the classical limit."}

Among them, $f(R)$ gravity represents a minimal and theoretically appealing class, characterized by the Compton wavelength parameter $B_0$, which quantifies deviations from General Relativity. In this work, we explore the capability of future neutral hydrogen (HI) 21 cm intensity mapping (IM) observations to constrain $f(R)$ gravity at low redshifts. We perform Fisher-matrix forecasts for $B_0$ and standard cosmological parameters using upcoming 21 cm IM experiments, including BINGO and SKA1-MID (Band 1 and Band 2), both individually and in combination with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) priors. We find that even near-term experiments such as BINGO are able to place nontrivial bounds on $B_0$, $σ(B_0)\\simeq 2.27\\times 10^{-6}$, while SKA1-MID yields substantially tighter constraints, with SKA Band 2 providing the strongest sensitivity among the considered configurations, $σ(B_0)\\simeq 6.37\\times 10^{-8}$. We further demonstrate that the combination of low-redshift 21 cm IM data with CMB observations efficiently breaks degeneracies with background cosmological parameters and leads to a significant improvement in the constraints on $B_0$. These results highlight the potential of future HI intensity mapping surveys, in combination with CMB measurements, to provide stringent tests of General Relativity on cosmological scales."}

In this work, we demonstrate that this relation can be generalized to arbitrary luminosity distributions and spectral profiles. We derive the corresponding expression for the effective spectral index and apply it to a sample of quasars observed in the W1 band of the CatWISE survey.

Using JWST/NIRCam WFSS data, we identified 487 galaxies at $5.3 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 7.0$ exhibiting [OIII] emission. Among these, 122 [OIII] emitters lie within $|Δv_{\\rm los}| < 1000~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$ of the quasars, corresponding to a $\\sim9.4$-fold enhancement relative to the average galaxy density at other redshifts.

This intriguing result has been interpreted by some authors as arising from essentially replacing the black hole's effective potential and its perturbation with two disjoint potential barriers. We argue that such an analysis may have oversimplified the real physical scenario. To be more precise, a metric perturbation planted farther away from the black hole horizon might not always be appropriately approximated by a disjoint minor barrier. Particularly, for the perturbed Pöschl-Teller potential, joint and disjoint metric perturbations might lead to drastically different stability properties for the low-lying modes. Following this line of thought, this study conducts a refined analysis of the stability of the fundamental mode of the Regge-Wheeler effective potential by closely examining a few physically relevant ingredients. While our analysis qualitatively confirms the main findings of previous studies, as the stability of the fundamental mode is primarily determined by the imaginary part of the quasinormal frequency, we show that specific features of both the effective potential at spatial infinity and the metric perturbation can have a sizable impact on the instability. In contrast, the spiral period, governed by the real part of the quasinormal frequency, appears largely insensitive to the details of the black hole metric or its perturbations. The analytic estimates are in reasonable agreement with the numerical results."}

We use a point-lens finite-source model for the microlensing light curve model and employ multi-stage selection procedures to identify microlensing candidates. From more than 25,000 variable candidates detected across all nights, we identify 12 microlensing candidates with light-curve timescales shorter than 5~hours, and among them, 4 secure candidates with high-significance detections. We estimate detection efficiencies using light-curve-level simulations that account for observational conditions and finite-source effects. Using a hierarchical Bayesian framework that combines the light-curve fitting information for each candidate with the Poisson statistics of the number of candidates, we derive constraints on parameters that characterize the abundance and mass scale of primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter. First, we derive upper limits on the PBH abundance under the null hypothesis that all events are assumed to be false detections. Next, employing the PBH hypothesis in which all (or only secure) candidates are assumed to be due to PBH microlensing, we derive the allowed region of the PBH parameters; the inferred mass scale is $M_{\\rm PBH}\\sim10^{-7}$--$10^{-6}M_\\odot$, and the PBH abundance to the total dark matter is $f_{\\rm PBH}\\sim \\mathcal{O}(10^{-2}{\\rm -}10^{-1})$.

The bright and unresolved nuclear emission implies large optical depths ($τ_{667μm}$ >0.5, corresponding to $N_H > 10^{25}$ cm^-2) of hot dust at >500 K. In addition, JWST observations of the source show strong mid-infrared (mid-IR) absorption in the ro-vibrational bands of H2O nu_2=1-0 (5-7 $μ$m) and of other species including CO, HCN, C2H2, CH4, and CO2, and Herschel/PACS observations exhibit strong and saturated absorption due to OH, H2O, CH^+, and CH. We propose a model in which the unresolved ALMA submillimeter and JWST mid-IR continua trace the same nuclear source, the former penetrating deep into the nucleus and the latter probing the nuclear photosphere. The continuum model, which includes trapping of photons (the \"greenhouse\" effect), indicates that the nuclear ($R_h$ ~ 13 pc) luminosity and luminosity surface density are ~10$^{12}$ Lsun and $Σ_{bol}$~ 5e8 Lsun pc^-2, arising from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) so buried that high-ionization lines are completely obscured. The observed mid-IR gas-phase molecular bands probe outflowing gas with velocities of ~160 km s^-1 and are reproduced with the predicted $T_{dust}$ profile, while the far-IR molecular absorption lines are generated in the surrounding thick disk or torus with $τ_{100 μm}$~10. We conclude that IRAS 07251-0248 harbors a compact obscured nucleus (CON) that hides an AGN currently emitting at quasar luminosity. While the observed outflow could be driven by radiation pressure, we favor the scenario of a (partially) energy-conserving hot bubble caught in a very early phase of the expulsion of the highly concentrated gas at the galactic nucleus."}

Utilizing numerical relativity, we achieve stable, long-term evolution of this system and perform a comparative analysis across various parameter spaces. Our comprehensive investigation reveals the formation of a hairy black hole, whose final state is governed by a diverse set of physical parameters. Notably, the decay constant in the axion potential, representing nonlinear interactions, bifurcates the superradiant instability into two distinct behavioral regimes, leading to more significant dynamical shifts than previously reported. Furthermore, we examine the influence of the scalar field's charge and mass, as well as the mirror's position. We investigate the axionic bosenova process and observe a long-term beating pattern of the axion field induced by nonlinear interactions. By fine-tuning these parameter combinations, we demonstrate that the system can evolve toward a variety of distinct physical endpoints."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "Understanding how galaxies trace the underlying matter density field is essential for characterizing the influence of the large-scale structure on galaxy formation, being therefore a key ingredient in observational cosmology. This connection, commonly described through the galaxy bias, $b$, can be studied effectively using machine learning (ML) techniques, which offer strong predictive capabilities and can capture non-linear relationships. We aim to incorporate the linear bias parameter assigned to individual galaxies into a ML framework, quantify its dependence on various halo and environmental properties, and evaluate whether different algorithms can accurately predict this parameter and reproduce the scatter in several bias relations. We use data from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation, including the distance to different cosmic-web structures computed with DisPerSE. These data are complemented with an object-by-object estimator of the large-scale linear bias ($b_i$), providing the individual contribution of each galaxy to the bias of the entire population. Our ML framework uses three models to predict $b_i$: a Random Forest Regressor, a Neural Network and a probabilistic method (Normalizing Flows). We recover the full hierarchy of galaxy bias dependencies, showing that the most informative features are the overdensities, particularly $δ_8$, followed by the distances to cosmic-web structures and selected internal halo properties, most notably $z_{1/2}$. We also demonstrate that Normalizing Flows clearly outperform deterministic methods in predicting galaxy bias, including its joint distributions with galaxy properties, owing to their ability to capture the intrinsic variance associated with the stochastic nature of the matter-halo-galaxy connection. Our ML framework provides a foundation for future efforts to measure individual bias with upcoming spectroscopic surveys."}

Due to the strong interactions, analytical orbit integrations are insufficient to analyze the past galaxy orbits accurately. Therefore, we use a genetic algorithm in combination with N-body simulations to determine the LMC and SMC initial positions and velocities 2.5 Gyr ago that result in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) arriving near their observed locations and velocities at the current time. After running ~8,000 simulations, our best matching model includes two close interactions between the MCs (940 Myr and 140 Myr ago) and reproduces some observed features of the MCs, including the LMC disc warp, a ring-shaped overdensity in the LMC, the tidal expansion of the SMC, and a greater distance dispersion on the eastern side of the SMC. The LMC disc warp is caused by the most recent interaction with the SMC, which occurred ~140 Myr before the present.

The simplest explanation envisages the presence of a quintessence field rolling into a potential, where the Dark Energy energy density parameter $Ω_{DE}=Ω_Λ+Ω_{x}$ results from the contribution of the ground state energy $Ω_Λ$ and the scalar field energy $Ω_{x}$. Provided that $Ω_{DE}\\approx 0.7$, negative values of $Ω_Λ$ can be consistent with current measurements from cosmological probes, and could help in explaining the large abundance of bright galaxies observed by JWST at $z> 10$, largely exceeding the pre-JWST expectations in a $ΛCDM$ Universe. Here we explore to what extent such a scenario can account also for the early presence of massive Black Holes (BHs) with masses $M_{BH}\\gtrsim 10^7\\,M_{\\odot}$ observed at $z\\gtrsim 8$, and for the large over-abundance of AGN with respect to pre-JWST expectations.

To this aim we develop a simple analytic framework to connect the growth of dark matter halos to the maximal growth of BHs within the above assumptions. We show such models can account for present observations assuming values of $Ω_Λ\\approx -1$, simultaneously boosting both galaxy and AGN number counts without invoking any additional physics. This would allow us to trace the observed excess of bright and massive galaxies and the early formation of massive Black Holes and the abundance of AGN to the same cosmological origin."}

By fitting the observed masses and luminosities of J0313--1806 ($z=7.64$) and J0100+2802 ($z=6.30$) with Bayesian inference, we infer initial conditions that favor massive seed black holes with initial mass $M_0 \\sim 10^{6}\\,M_\\odot$, formed at $z\\sim20{-}30$ in environments with baryonic overdensity factors $f_ρ\\gtrsim 50$ relative to the cosmic mean.

Confronting this framework with inflationary observables, growth of structure and the observed near flatness of the universe, we derive strong infrared constraints that suppress non Hermiticity across cosmic history.

The observations were taken with the INTEGRAL spectrograph at the William Herschel Telescope (WHT). Our IFU data cube partially covers knots J1, J2, and completely covers knots J3, J4 in the system. Optical Recombination Lines of C II, He I, He II, N III, O II and Collisionally Excited Lines of [Ar IV], [Ar V], [N II], [Ne III], [Ne IV], and [O III] were detected. Our integrated flux maps visualise the ionisation structure and the chemical inhomogeneity in the system previously reported by other groups. We find that ORLs are concentrated in the polar region (J1, J3), whereas the equatorial knots (J2, J4) are dominated by CELs. The flux ratio map of the diagnostic [O III] lambda 5007/4363 Angstrom lines reveals the electron temperature distribution, which shows cold cores of 15,000 K in knots J3 and J4 surrounded by a hot outer layer of above 20,000 K. Our channel maps show positive and negative velocity excursions from the systemic value among the ions. Several ions show variation in their velocity structures from their lower-energy-level counterparts, including [Ar IV] and [Ar V], [Ne III] and [Ne IV], and He I and He II. New recurrent velocity structures are identified in the low-density regions where the ions move much faster compared to their surrounding environments. The velocity dispersion measurements highlight extreme turbulence in some of the ions (sigma_vrad approx 140 km/s), consistent with supersonic/hypersonic motion driven by shocks. The forbidden line species [N II] exhibits lower turbulence (sigma_vrad approx 50-60 km/s), tracing denser, less-turbulent gases. Based on our data, we conclude both the ionisation and kinematic studies hint at shock heating and multiple ejection history in the evolutionary pathway of A30."}

We review these definitions in a common frame and perform a detailed study of the resulting multipole moments for the Kerr event horizon. The horizon multipoles are found to share several properties with the (Hansen) field multipoles, including parity constraints and the leading scaling behavior with respect to the Kerr spin parameter a in the regime of small a. For the axisymmetry-based definition, we have obtained a closed-form expression of the multipole moments in terms of a and the spherical harmonic degree l. For the generic definition, we have established closed-form expressions for the conformal unit round metric, the `electric' and `magnetic' potentials related to the multipoles, and the values of the multipoles in the small a limit. We show that the two definitions lead to different values of the Kerr horizon multipoles as soon as l >= 1 (generic nonzero value of a) or l >= 2 (small a limit)."}

For the past $5-6~\\mathrm{Gyr}$ , it has been heavily stripped by the Milky Way (MW), losing most of its mass while crossing the MW disc multiple times. Recent models of Milky Way disc perturbations $-$ including the spiral arms, the stellar bar, the Gaia phase spiral, and stellar and gaseous disc corrugations $-$ have identified these crossings as possible formation triggers, but have generally treated each perturbation in isolation. Here, we adopt a holistic perspective and ask whether a single disc-crossing impulse can simultaneously account for these features as observed today. We focus on simulations of single disc-crossing events by a Sgr-like perturber, and present a forensic analysis of the role of the powerful impulse in forming spiral arms, disc corrugations, the phase spiral and the `$L_{z}-\\bar{V}_{R}$ wave', determined from a star's angular momentum and radial velocity, respectively. We find that a single disc crossing can reproduce reasonably well (e.g. structure, amplitude, phase) the observed local disc corrugation, and the Outer, Local and Sagittarius-Carina arm segments, implying that the last significant impulse due to a transit took place $700-1200~\\mathrm{Myr}$ ago. Moreover, the $L_{z}-\\bar{V}_{R}$ wave and phase spiral appear within the simulations over the same epoch and their general structure is reasonably well replicated, but not in detail. We conclude that Sgr's last significant crossing roughly a Gyr ago could be the primary cause of large-scale MW disc perturbations, but it cannot fully account for the $L_{z}-\\bar{V}_{R}$ wave. Consequently, other triggers, possibly the Galactic bar or interactions with other satellites, must be considered in order to fully explain the current dynamical state of the MW's disc."}

We find that the model indeed produces localized, quasi-spherical structures compatible with oscillons, which might lead to signatures detectable by future experiments. However, in agreement with recent works, we find that although the abundance of gravitational waves that could be generated in this regime has an amplitude well within the sensitivities of these detectors, the frequency range is on the GHz limit, away from the expected frequencies. Finally, we estimate the impact of a coupling of the type $yφσ^2$ to the inflaton, in the realization of perturbative reheating, directly impacting the predictions of the model, as lower values of $M$ are consistent with both the entire allowed temperature range, and the limits imposed by BICEP/Keck Array+Planck+ACT."}

The magnetization level also plays a crucial role, with weakly magnetized envelopes exhibiting predominantly parallel or random alignment, whereas strongly magnetized ones show perpendicular configurations even at moderate densities.

Semenov"], "title": "How Do Disk Galaxies Form?", "comment": "24 pages, 11 figures; submitted to ApJ; comments are welcome", "summary": "In both observed and simulated galaxies, disk morphologies become more prevalent at higher masses and lower redshifts. To elucidate the physical origin of this trend, we develop a simple analytical model in which galaxy morphology is governed by the competition between rotational support and turbulence in a gravitational potential of a dark matter halo and the galaxy itself, and a disk forms when the potential steepens due to the accumulation of baryons in the halo center. The minimum galaxy mass required for this transition decreases with an increasing dark matter contribution within the galaxy, making more concentrated halos more prone to forming disks. Our model predicts that galaxy sizes behave qualitatively differently before and after disk formation: after disks form, sizes are governed by the halo spin, in agreement with classical models, whereas before disk formation, sizes are larger and set by the scale on which turbulent motions, which dominate over rotation, can be contained. We validate our model against the results of the TNG50 cosmological simulation and, despite the simplicity of the model, find remarkable agreement. In particular, our model explains the increase with redshift in the critical halo mass for disk formation, reported in both simulations and observations, as a consequence of the evolution of the halo mass-concentration and baryonic mass-halo mass relations. This redshift trend therefore supports the recent proposal that it is the steepening of the gravitational potential that causes disk formation, while other effects discussed in the literature, such as potential deepening and hot gaseous halo formation, can still play important roles in the transition from early turbulent to dynamically cold disks."}

The unexpectedly high abundance of these molecules indicates an extremely rich hydrocarbon chemistry, not explained by high-temperature gas-phase chemistry, ice desorption or oxygen depletion. Instead, the most plausible explanation is the erosion and fragmentation of carbonaceous grains and PAHs. This scenario is supported by the correlation between the abundance of one of their main fragmentation products, C$_2$H$_2$, and cosmic ray (CR) ionization rate for a sample of local ULIRGs. These hydrocarbons are outflowing at $\\sim$160 km/s, which may represent a potential formation pathway for hydrogenated amorphous grains.

Provided that $Ω_{DE}\\approx 0.7$, negative values of $Ω_Λ$ can be consistent with current measurements from cosmological probes, and could help in explaining the large abundance of bright galaxies observed by JWST at $z> 10$, largely exceeding the pre-JWST expectations in a $ΛCDM$ Universe. Here we explore to what extent such a scenario can account also for the early presence of massive Black Holes (BHs) with masses $M_{BH}\\gtrsim 10^7\\,M_{\\odot}$ observed at $z\\gtrsim 8$, and for the large over-abundance of AGN with respect to pre-JWST expectations. Our aim is not to provide a detailed description of BH growth, but rather to compute the maximal BH growth that can occur in cosmological models with negative $Ω_Λ$ under the simple assumption of Eddington-limited accretion onto initial light Black Hole seeds with mass $M_{seed}\\sim 10^2\\,M_{\\odot}$ originated from PopIII stars. To this aim we develop a simple analytic framework to connect the growth of dark matter halos to the maximal growth of BHs within the above assumptions. We show such models can account for present observations assuming values of $Ω_Λ\\approx -1$, simultaneously boosting both galaxy and AGN number counts without invoking any additional physics. This would allow us to trace the observed excess of bright and massive galaxies and the early formation of massive Black Holes and the abundance of AGN to the same cosmological origin."}

A critical step in analyzing IFS data is the decomposition of emission lines, where different velocity components are often modeled with Gaussian profiles.

Here, we present Emission Line Fitting Optimization (ELFO), a Python package for IFS spectral fitting. ELFO uses the results of neighboring spectra to determine multiple initial guesses and selects the result that exhibits spatial smoothness. We tested ELFO on IFS data of two quasars obtained from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, where it successfully corrected anomalous fits, revealed previously unresolved substructures, and made large-scale kinematic structures more evident. With minor modifications, this method can also be easily adapted to other IFS data and different emission lines."}

Moffat"], "title": "Suppression of Gravitational-Wave Echoes in Diffeomorphism-Invariant Nonlocal Gravity", "comment": null, "summary": "Searches for late--time gravitational--wave echoes following compact binary mergers are often interpreted as probes of exotic near--horizon or horizonless physics. We show that a well--motivated class of ultraviolet--finite quantum gravity and modified gravity theories, those based on diffeomorphism--invariant, analytic, entire--function nonlocality, generically suppress observable echo signals. The suppression follows from Paley--Wiener bounds associated with the analyticity of the nonlocal regulator, which enforce exponential damping of high--frequency reflection amplitudes and smear sharp effective potentials in the black--hole interior. We demonstrate that for regular black holes with horizons, the standard ingoing boundary condition eliminates the cavity required for echoes, while for regular horizonless compact objects the nonlocal kernel strongly attenuates both inner and photon--sphere reflections. As a result, repeated reflections during the ringdown phase are exponentially suppressed in frequency space and washed out in the time domain. Our results imply that the absence of echoes in current gravitational--wave data is consistent with covariant nonlocal gravity theories and does not, by itself, favor classical horizons over regular or horizonless ultraviolet completions. The analyticity and Paley--Wiener bounds that enforce echo suppression are required to ensure unitarity, ghost freedom, and ultraviolet finiteness of the underlying quantum theory. As a result, the classical ringdown phenomenology already encodes quantum--gravity consistency conditions. We emphasize that the absence of echoes in such theories does not rely on quantum decoherence or stochastic effects, but instead reflects the analytic structure imposed by quantum gravity on the classical limit."}

We combine new \\textit{JWST}/NIRCam broadband and medium-band imaging with archival \\textit{HST}/ACS data to perform spatially resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using the \\textsc{Bagpipes} software package. Our analysis reveals that two of the systems are minor mergers, while the third is a major merger. The close agreement between spatially resolved and integrated stellar mass estimates indicates that recent star formation does not significantly outshine the light from older stellar populations in these systems. Moreover, both the individual components and the systems as a whole lie on the star-forming main sequence, further supporting the conclusion that these mergers have not yet triggered substantial starburst activity. Furthermore, we detect prominent color gradients and disturbed dust distributions in these merging systems, indicating that the mergers have already induced significant internal structural perturbations. These morphological and dust-related changes may facilitate the escape of Ly$α$ photons -- potentially through mechanisms such as gas redistribution or a reduced covering fraction of neutral hydrogen -- thereby playing a key role in shaping the observed properties of LAEs."}

Confronting this framework with inflationary observables, growth of structure and the observed near flatness of the universe, we derive strong infrared constraints that suppress non Hermiticity across cosmic history. We demonstrate that these bounds are mutually consistent between early and late-time probes and can be partially relaxed in theories beyond General Relativity. Our results establish cosmology as a novel arena for testing foundational aspects of quantum mechanics and suggest that Hermiticity may emerge dynamically along the semiclassical branch describing our universe."}

We present a multi-wavelength analysis of three dynamically active groups: SDSSTG8102, SDSSTG16393, and SDSSTG28674, which are part of the XMM-Newton Group AGN Project X-GAP sample, a statistically complete sample of 49 galaxy groups. We combine uGMRT 400 MHz observations with 144 MHz LOFAR and XMM-Newton observations to study the radio sources associated with the Brightest Group Galaxies (BGGs). The BGGs in SDSSTG8102 and SDSSTG16393 have extended radio emission with asymmetric distortions in their morphologies. SDSSTG28674 has a compact flat-spectrum radio source associated with the BGG and an extended lobe on one side, connected by a faint bridge detected with LOFAR. Integrated spectral indices of the three BGGs are $-0.96\\pm0.09$ (SDSSTG8102), $-1.35\\pm0.09$ (SDSSTG16393), and $-1.6\\pm0.02$ (SDSSTG28674). X-ray images reveal elongated morphologies in all three groups, with SDSSTG28674 showing evidence of a binary merger, while thermodynamical maps highlight temperature variations. In SDSSTG8102, lobes are bent and displaced by IGrM flows, while SDSSTG16393 hosts steep-spectrum relic-like plasma coinciding with X-ray emission. SDSSTG28674, with its ultra-steep spectrum lobe and disturbed morphology, likely traces merger-driven activity, consistent with a remnant or revived radio phoenix. The spectral diversity across the systems reflects different stages of AGN fading governed by duty cycle, source age, and confinement by the hot IGrM."}

We measure relatively high stellar metallicities for the majority of our sample, consistent with similar objects at $0 < z < 3$. Finally, we explore evidence for $α$-enhancement in six older and more luminous galaxies within our sample, finding considerable disagreements in the chemical abundances measured using different stellar population models, different fitted rest-frame wavelength ranges, star-formation history models and fitting codes. We therefore conclude that inferring detailed stellar chemical abundances for the earliest quiescent galaxies remains challenging, and higher signal-to-noise spectra are required (SNR per resolution element $>100$ for $R\\simeq1000$)."}

Observations of AGN outflows typically probe a separate outflow phase: cool/warm gas with $T \\lesssim 10^5 \\, \\rm K$. Here, we show that the density of cool outflowing gas scales with AGN luminosity, serving as an indirect diagnostic of the elusive hot, shocked wind. We use hydrodynamic simulations with the moving-mesh code AREPO to target the interaction between a small-scale AGN wind of speed $\\approx 10^4 \\, \\rm km \\, s^{-1}$ and galactic discs containing an idealised, clumpy interstellar medium (ISM).

We extract an ensemble of cool clouds from the AGN-driven outflows produced in our simulations, finding that their densities increase systematically with AGN wind power and AGN luminosity. Moreover, the mass distribution and internal properties of these cloudlets appear to be insensitive to the initial properties of the ISM, and shaped mainly by the dynamics of radiative, turbulent mixing layers. The increase in cool outflow density with kinetic wind power and AGN luminosity has profound implications for observational estimates of outflow rates and their scaling with AGN luminosity.

It has been shown that the assumed scaling of $b_φ(z)=2δ_c (b_1(z)-1)$ is not accurate for realistically simulated galaxies, and depends both on the galaxy selection and the way that galaxies are modeled. To address this, we leverage the CAMELS-SAM pipeline to explore how varying parameters of galaxy formation affects $b_φ$ and $b_1$ for various galaxy selections. We run separate-universe N-body simulations of $L=205 h^{-1}$ cMpc and $N=1280^3$ to measure $b_φ$, and run 55 unique instances of the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model with varying parameters of stellar and AGN feedback. We find the behavior and evolution of a SC-SAM model's stellar-, SFR- and sSFR- to halo mass relationships track well with how $b_1$ and $b_φ(b_1)$ change across redshift and selection for the SC-SAM. We find our variations of the SC-SAM encapsulate the $b_φ$ behavior previously measured in IllustrisTNG, the Munich SAM, and Galacticus.Finally, we identify sSFR selections as particularly robust to varied galaxy modeling."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "Understanding how galaxies trace the underlying matter density field is essential for characterizing the influence of the large-scale structure on galaxy formation, being therefore a key ingredient in observational cosmology. This connection, commonly described through the galaxy bias, $b$, can be studied effectively using machine learning (ML) techniques, which offer strong predictive capabilities and can capture non-linear relationships. We aim to incorporate the linear bias parameter assigned to individual galaxies into a ML framework, quantify its dependence on various halo and environmental properties, and evaluate whether different algorithms can accurately predict this parameter and reproduce the scatter in several bias relations. We use data from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation, including the distance to different cosmic-web structures computed with DisPerSE. These data are complemented with an object-by-object estimator of the large-scale linear bias ($b_i$), providing the individual contribution of each galaxy to the bias of the entire population. Our ML framework uses three models to predict $b_i$: a Random Forest Regressor, a Neural Network and a probabilistic method (Normalizing Flows). We recover the full hierarchy of galaxy bias dependencies, showing that the most informative features are the overdensities, particularly $δ_8$, followed by the distances to cosmic-web structures and selected internal halo properties, most notably $z_{1/2}$. We also demonstrate that Normalizing Flows clearly outperform deterministic methods in predicting galaxy bias, including its joint distributions with galaxy properties, owing to their ability to capture the intrinsic variance associated with the stochastic nature of the matter-halo-galaxy connection. Our ML framework provides a foundation for future efforts to measure individual bias with upcoming spectroscopic surveys."}

Shankar"], "title": "Early growth of massive black holes in dynamical dark energy models with negative cosmological constant", "comment": "10 pages, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics", "summary": "Recent results from combined cosmological probes indicate that the Dark Energy component of the Universe could be dynamical. The simplest explanation envisages the presence of a quintessence field rolling into a potential, where the Dark Energy energy density parameter $Ω_{DE}=Ω_Λ+Ω_{x}$ results from the contribution of the ground state energy $Ω_Λ$ and the scalar field energy $Ω_{x}$. Provided that $Ω_{DE}\\approx 0.7$, negative values of $Ω_Λ$ can be consistent with current measurements from cosmological probes, and could help in explaining the large abundance of bright galaxies observed by JWST at $z> 10$, largely exceeding the pre-JWST expectations in a $ΛCDM$ Universe. Here we explore to what extent such a scenario can account also for the early presence of massive Black Holes (BHs) with masses $M_{BH}\\gtrsim 10^7\\,M_{\\odot}$ observed at $z\\gtrsim 8$, and for the large over-abundance of AGN with respect to pre-JWST expectations. Our aim is not to provide a detailed description of BH growth, but rather to compute the maximal BH growth that can occur in cosmological models with negative $Ω_Λ$ under the simple assumption of Eddington-limited accretion onto initial light Black Hole seeds with mass $M_{seed}\\sim 10^2\\,M_{\\odot}$ originated from PopIII stars. To this aim we develop a simple analytic framework to connect the growth of dark matter halos to the maximal growth of BHs within the above assumptions. We show such models can account for present observations assuming values of $Ω_Λ\\approx -1$, simultaneously boosting both galaxy and AGN number counts without invoking any additional physics. This would allow us to trace the observed excess of bright and massive galaxies and the early formation of massive Black Holes and the abundance of AGN to the same cosmological origin."}

Ferreira"], "title": "Testing cosmic anisotropy with cluster scaling relations", "comment": "Comments welcome. To be submitted to MNRAS", "summary": "We test claims of large-scale anisotropy in the local expansion rate using cluster scaling relations as distance indicators. Using a Bayesian forward model, we jointly fit the X-ray luminosity--temperature (LT) and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich--temperature (YT) relations, marginalising over the latent cluster distances and modelling selection effects as well as peculiar velocities. The latter are modelled using reconstructions of the local peculiar velocity field where we self-consistently account for possible anisotropic redshift--distance relations via an approximate scheme. This treatment proves crucial to the inferred anisotropy and breaks the degeneracy between anisotropy in scaling relation normalisations and underlying cosmological anisotropy. We apply our method to 312 clusters at $z \\lesssim 0.2$, testing dipolar, quadrupolar and general (pixelised) anisotropy models. Bayesian model selection finds no more than weak evidence for any anisotropic model. For dipole models, we obtain upper limits of $δH_0 / H_0 < 3.2\\%$ and bulk flow magnitude $< 1300\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$. Our results contrast with previous claims of statistically significant anisotropy from the same data, which we attribute to our principled forward modelling of both redshifts and scaling relation observables through latent distances and our treatment of the impact of anisotropic redshift--distance relations when modelling the local peculiar velocity field. Our work highlights the importance of accurately modelling peculiar velocities when testing isotropy with distance indicators, and motivates the further development of reconstructions that self-consistently treat large-scale deviations from the Hubble flow."}
