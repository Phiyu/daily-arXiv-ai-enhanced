In detail, we incorporated 77,000 HST pixels, in addition to the known 106 point-like multiple images, in our modeling. We considered four different models to explore the effect of the relative weighting of the point-like multiple image positions and flux distribution of the SN host on the model optimization. When the SN host's extended image is included, we find that the statistical uncertainties of all 34 free model parameters are reduced by factors ranging from one to two orders of magnitude compared to the statistical uncertainty of the point-like only model, irrespective of the adopted different image weights. We quantified the remarkably increased level of precision with which the cluster's total mass and the predicted time delays of the SN Refsdal multiple image positions can be reconstructed. We also show the delensed image of the SN host, a spiral galaxy at zSN = 1.49, in multiple HST bands. In all those applications, we obtain a significant reduction of the statistical uncertainty, which is now below the level of even the small systematic uncertainty on the mass model that could be assessed by the different approaches. These results demonstrate that with extended image models of lensing clusters it is possible to measure the cluster's total mass distribution, the values of the cosmological parameters, and the physical properties of high-redshift sources with an unparalleled precision, making the typically not-quantified systematic uncertainties now crucial.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u54c8\u52c3\u592a\u7a7a\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\uff08HST\uff09\u6df1\u573a\u56fe\u50cf\u548cMUSE\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u7ed3\u5408\u8d85\u65b0\u661fRefsdal\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u9762\u4eae\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u6784\u5efaMACS J1149.5+2223\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u8d28\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4ec5\u7528\u70b9\u72b6\u591a\u91cd\u50cf\u5efa\u6a21\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u5ef6\u5c55\u56fe\u50cf\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u8d28\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u6e90\u7269\u7406\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u878d\u540877,000\u4e2aHST\u50cf\u7d20\uff08\u5373SN\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\u5ef6\u5c55\u8868\u9762\u4eae\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u4e0e106\u4e2a\u5df2\u77e5\u70b9\u72b6\u591a\u91cd\u50cf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u6743\u91cd\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u5ef6\u5c55\u50cf\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u52a0\u5165\u5ef6\u5c55\u56fe\u50cf\u540e\uff0c\u5168\u90e834\u4e2a\u81ea\u7531\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u964d\u4f4e1\u20132\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff1b\u603b\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0eRefsdal\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u5404\u50cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\uff1b\u83b7\u5f97z=1.49\u87ba\u65cb\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u53bb\u900f\u955c\u5316\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u5df2\u4f4e\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bef\u5dee\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5ef6\u5c55\u56fe\u50cf\u5efa\u6a21\u53ef\u6781\u5927\u63d0\u5347\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u53ca\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u6e90\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f80\u5e38\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bef\u5dee\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

This cross-covariance is essential for joint analyses that combine full-shape clustering information with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, as commonly performed in modern spectroscopic surveys. Our model builds on the disconnected contribution to the covariance and accounts for the damping of correlations due to the BAO reconstruction process. We validate our analytic prescription against numerical simulations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), testing both idealized cubic geometries and realistic survey configurations including complex footprints and fiber assignment effects. Despite neglecting survey window functions in the analytic calculation, we find excellent agreement with simulation-based covariances and demonstrate that cosmological parameter constraints are virtually unchanged when using our approximation. Our results show that the pre-post cross-covariance is sufficiently small that even approximate treatments are adequate for cosmological inference, opening a pathway toward fully analytic covariance matrices for next-generation galaxy surveys.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u89e3\u6790\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u661f\u7cfb\u529f\u7387\u8c31\uff08\u9884\u91cd\u6784\uff09\u4e0e\u4e24\u70b9\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u540e\u91cd\u6784\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728DESI\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u4ea4\u53c9\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5de1\u5929\u7684\u5168\u89e3\u6790\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u6784\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5f62\u805a\u7c7b\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0eBAO\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9700\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u9884\u91cd\u6784\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u4e0e\u540e\u91cd\u6784\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u975e\u8fde\u901a\u90e8\u5206\u6784\u5efa\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165BAO\u91cd\u6784\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8870\u51cf\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u672a\u8003\u8651\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a97\u53e3\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u5728DESI\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff08\u542b\u7406\u60f3\u7acb\u65b9\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5de1\u5929\u6784\u578b\uff09\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6240\u5f97\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u9884-\u540e\u4ea4\u53c9\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u672c\u8eab\u8db3\u591f\u5c0f\uff0c\u7c97\u7565\u5904\u7406\u5373\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u89e3\u6790\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53ef\u9760\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u661f\u7cfb\u5de1\u5929\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u89e3\u6790\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "The analysis of the large-scale clustering of quasars (QSO) observed by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) represents a promising avenue for constraining local Primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), parameterized by $f_{\\rm NL}$. The signal to be constrained is the scale-dependent bias induced in the 2-point clustering of the considered tracer sample. The resulting constraints on $f_{\\rm NL}$, however, are fully degenerate with the local PNG bias parameter $b_\u03c6$, dependent on the assembly bias parameter $p$. Using IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations, we select a QSO sample reflecting the selection criteria and properties of DESI QSOs, and provide a robust prior for $p$, and thus for $b_\u03c6$, building on the findings of Fondi et al. 2024.

Submitted to ApJ", "summary": "We investigate the physical origin of star formation suppression in gas-rich early-type galaxies using five high-resolution hydrodynamical idealized galaxy simulations, performed with the moving-mesh code AREPO. These simulations include one Milky Way-like galaxy and four early-type galaxies, of which one early-type galaxy is found to have significantly less star formation despite a substantial molecular gas reservoir. We apply a modified virial theorem to the overdensities in each galaxy to quantify the forces regulating their stability and thus star formation. We find evidence that, in the suppressed galaxy, strong Coriolis forces driven by elevated galactic shear may inhibit gravitational collapse. This is caused by the galaxy's high central compactness, providing a physical mechanism for the suppression of star formation that does not require the removal of molecular gas. In contrast, less compact early-type galaxies host more gravity-dominated clouds and therefore exhibit higher star formation rates. However, we find that this gravitational stability occurs without significantly increasing the classical Toomre-Q parameter, and therefore a new criterion for suppressed star formation may be needed. We also discuss the impact of our choice of overdensity scale and connections to observations of molecular clouds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u4e2d\u5fc3\u81f4\u5bc6\u6027\u65e9\u578b\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5f3a\u79d1\u91cc\u5965\u5229\u529b\u53ef\u6291\u5236\u5206\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u574d\u7f29\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u51cf\u5c11\u6c14\u4f53\u50a8\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u538b\u5236\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\uff1b\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u88ab\u4f20\u7edfToomre-Q\u53c2\u6570\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u5224\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5bcc\u6c14\u4f53\u65e9\u578b\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u88ab\u538b\u5236\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e3a\u4f55\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u5206\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u5374\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528AREPO\u4ee3\u7801\u5f00\u5c55\u4e94\u4e2a\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff08\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4f53\u548c\u56db\u4e2a\u65e9\u578b\u661f\u7cfb\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5404\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5bc6\u533a\u5e94\u7528\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u7ef4\u91cc\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u8c03\u63a7\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u529b\u5b66\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u88ab\u663e\u8457\u538b\u5236\u7684\u65e9\u578b\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u9ad8\u4e2d\u5fc3\u81f4\u5bc6\u6027\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u5f3a\u661f\u7cfb\u526a\u5207\u9a71\u52a8\u5f3a\u79d1\u91cc\u5965\u5229\u529b\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u5f15\u529b\u574d\u7f29\uff1b\u800c\u81f4\u5bc6\u6027\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u65e9\u578b\u661f\u7cfb\u5219\u4e91\u56e2\u66f4\u53d7\u5f15\u529b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3001\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b\u8be5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u672a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ecf\u5178Toomre-Q\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u5fc3\u81f4\u5bc6\u6027\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u526a\u5207\u4e0e\u79d1\u91cc\u5965\u5229\u529b\u6765\u538b\u5236\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u79fb\u9664\u5206\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u7684\u65b0\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u73b0\u6709Toomre-Q\u5224\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u523b\u753b\u6b64\u7c7b\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u9700\u53d1\u5c55\u65b0\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5224\u636e\u3002"}}

Sullivan"], "title": "On The Stability Of $H_0$ And The Inverse Distance Ladder", "comment": null, "summary": "The `Inverse Distance Ladder' uses relative-distance measurements with type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), anchored to an absolute distance scale from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and the cosmic microwave background (CMB), to provide an alternative measurement technique for the local expansion rate $H_0$. Using SNe Ia from the Dark Energy Survey and BAO measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, we show that the inverse distance ladder is unable to explain the Hubble Tension, anchored as it is to the CMB and its value of $H_0 = 67.4 \\pm 0.5$ kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. To do so, we first show that the suite of systematics considered in cosmology analyses with SNe Ia only move the inferred $H_0$ by $<0.1$kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, and second, we investigate the scale of redshift-dependent magnitude changes necessary to change the inferred inverse distance ladder $H_0$ from $67$ to the local network of distance measurements value of $73$, and the impact that this would have on other cosmological inferences with SNe Ia. We find that a change of $d\u03bc/dz = 0.2$ mag would be necessary to infer an $H_0$ in concordance with local distance measurements, and that this $d\u03bc/dz$ value would result in a Flat $\u039b$CDM $\u03a9_M = 0.23$, $10\u03c3$ discrepant with other cosmological probes, {indicating that the precision of SNe Ia measurements preclude the necessary redshift evolution for an $H_0$ of 74 kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$}. Therefore, we conclude that current SN Ia cosmology leaves little freedom for the inverse distance ladder to yield $H_0$ values significantly different from $67$ kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u5411\u8ddd\u79bb\u9636\u68af\u6cd5\uff08\u4f7f\u7528Ia\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u3001BAO\u548cCMB\u6570\u636e\uff09\u5206\u6790\u54c8\u52c3\u5e38\u6570H\u2080\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8eCMB\u951a\u5b9a\u503c\uff0867.4\u00b10.5 km/s/Mpc\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u672c\u5730\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u66f4\u9ad8H\u2080\u503c\uff08\u7ea673 km/s/Mpc\uff09\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bef\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5c0f\uff08<0.1 km/s/Mpc\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u82e5\u5f3a\u884c\u8c03\u9ad8H\u2080\u81f373\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u7ea2\u79fb\u4f9d\u8d56\u661f\u7b49\u53d8\u5316\uff08d\u03bc/dz=0.2 mag\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u5bfc\u81f4\u039bCDM\u6a21\u578b\u7269\u8d28\u5bc6\u5ea6\u03a9_M\u4e25\u91cd\u504f\u79bb\u5176\u4ed6\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0810\u03c3\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u5f53\u524dIa\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u6570\u636e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u9006\u5411\u8ddd\u79bb\u9636\u68af\u96be\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u504f\u79bbH\u2080\u224867 km/s/Mpc\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u54c8\u52c3\u5e38\u6570H\u2080\u7684\u201c\u54c8\u52c3\u5f20\u529b\u201d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u672c\u5730\u8ddd\u79bb\u6d4b\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u9020\u7236\u53d8\u661f+Ia\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\uff09\u5f97\u5230\u7684H\u2080\u224873 km/s/Mpc\u4e0eCMB\u63a8\u65ad\u7684H\u2080\u224867 km/s/Mpc\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5206\u6b67\uff1b\u68c0\u9a8c\u9006\u5411\u8ddd\u79bb\u9636\u68af\u6cd5\uff08\u4ee5CMB\u4e3a\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408BAO\u548cSNe Ia\uff09\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u5f20\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u5de1\u5929\uff08DES\uff09\u7684Ia\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u6570\u636e\u4e0eDESI\u7684\u91cd\u5b50\u58f0\u5b66\u632f\u8361\uff08BAO\uff09\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9006\u5411\u8ddd\u79bb\u9636\u68af\uff1b\u91cf\u5316\u5404\u7c7bIa\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bef\u5dee\u5bf9H\u2080\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e3a\u4f7f\u9006\u5411\u8ddd\u79bb\u9636\u68af\u63a8\u5f97H\u2080\u4ece67\u63d0\u5347\u81f373\u6240\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u7ea2\u79fb\u4f9d\u8d56\u661f\u7b49\u68af\u5ea6d\u03bc/dz\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u8be5\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u039bCDM\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u03a9_M\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "Ia\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bef\u5dee\u5bf9H\u2080\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\u4e8e0.1 km/s/Mpc\uff1b\u8981\u4f7f\u9006\u5411\u8ddd\u79bb\u9636\u68af\u5f97\u51faH\u2080=73 km/s/Mpc\uff0c\u9700d\u03bc/dz=0.2 mag\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u503c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4Flat \u039bCDM\u6a21\u578b\u03a9_M=0.23\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u5b83\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u63a2\u9488\u7ed3\u679c\u5b58\u572810\u03c3\u77db\u76fe\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9006\u5411\u8ddd\u79bb\u9636\u68af\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u57fa\u672c\u9501\u5b9aH\u2080\u224867 km/s/Mpc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eIa\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7684\u9006\u5411\u8ddd\u79bb\u9636\u68af\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u54c8\u52c3\u5f20\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u7262\u56fa\u951a\u5b9a\u4e8eCMB\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684H\u2080\u224867 km/s/Mpc\uff1bSNe Ia\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u8db3\u591f\u5f3a\u7684\u7ea2\u79fb\u6f14\u5316\u6548\u5e94\u6765\u663e\u8457\u62ac\u5347H\u2080\uff0c\u6545\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u7f13\u89e3\u5f20\u529b\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3002"}}

However, spin parameters are typically weakly constrained from data, and their inferred values are often strongly influenced by the assumed prior in Bayesian analyses. A commonly used prior, uniform in spin magnitudes and isotropic in spin directions, assigns vanishing probability density to spin-orbit-aligned configurations, potentially biasing inferences for BBH parameters. The prior choice can also affect population-level analyses by degrading the convergence of Monte Carlo integrations used to evaluate the likelihood in hierarchical Bayesian inference. In this work, we propose a novel spin prior that is uniform in the effective spin parameters Xeff and Xp, two spin combinations that can be relatively well measured from GW data, conditioned on the mass ratio. Using simulated BBH populations, we show that the inferred spin population can depend on the choice of prior, and that the proposed prior more accurately recovers the underlying spin population, particularly when the true distribution favors aligned-spin configurations. Because mass and spin measurements are correlated, our prior also enables a more accurate recovery of the underlying mass distribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u81ea\u65cb\u53c2\u6570Xeff\u548cXp\uff08\u6761\u4ef6\u4e8e\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u81ea\u65cb\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5e76\u5408\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u81ea\u65cb\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5411\u81ea\u65cb-\u8f68\u9053\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e38\u7528\u81ea\u65cb\u5148\u9a8c\uff08\u81ea\u65cb\u5927\u5c0f\u5747\u5300\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u65cb-\u8f68\u9053\u5bf9\u9f50\u5904\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e3a\u96f6\uff0c\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u53c2\u6570\u63a8\u65ad\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u5c42\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6709\u6548\u81ea\u65cb\u53c2\u6570Xeff\u548cXp\u4e0a\u5747\u5300\u3001\u4e14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e8e\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u7684\u65b0\u81ea\u65cb\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u79cd\u7fa4\u5f00\u5c55\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u5148\u9a8c\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u6062\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u5f53\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u56e0\u8d28\u91cf-\u81ea\u65cb\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u63d0\u5347\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u53ef\u6d4b\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u5747\u5300\u5148\u9a8c\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u5148\u9a8c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u6e90\u4e0e\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u53c2\u6570\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Broadband polarimetric observations in the 2-8 GHz range of the gravitationally lensed system CLASS B1152+199 were carried out over five epochs spanning three months with a cadence of roughly 20 days, and the differential birefringence angle ($\u0394\\,\u03b8_{a,{\\rm lens}}$) between the lensed images were estimated. We also combined an archival observation that effectively increases the span to 9.5 yr to probe the effect of an oscillating ALP field imprinted as oscillating ${\u0394\\,\u03b8_{a,{\\rm lens}}}$ over time. Here we present a new technique for combining multi-epoch measurements of ${\u0394\\,\u03b8_{a,{\\rm lens}}}$ by considering the coherence of the ALP field, such that, ${\u0394\\,\u03b8_{a,{\\rm lens}}}$ over these observations are related.

They are capable of reconstructing analytical functions directly from data points without introducing new physical models. A limitation of this approach is that while the reconstructed function is very efficient at reproducing the behaviour of the data points, non-observable quantities involving derivatives are particularly sensitive to stochasticity, hyperparameters, and to the choice of the best-fit function obtained by the GA, which implies the risk of the algorithm getting stuck in a local minimum. In this work we propose an update to the GA methodology for the reconstruction of analytical functions that involves computing a weighted average of an ensemble of GA configurations (\\texttt{GAME}). We define the weights via a quantity that accounts for both the goodness-of-fit of the points and the smoothness of the resulting function. We also present a practical method to analytically estimate and correct the errors on the averaged function by combining a path-integral approach with an ensemble variance. We demonstrate the improvement offered by \\texttt{GAME} methodology on a generic test function. We then apply the new methodology to a non-parametric reconstruction of the Hubble rate $H(z)$ using Cosmic Chronometers data and, assuming a flat Friedmann-Lema\u00eetre-Robertson-Walker background and General Relativity, we infer the corresponding dark energy equation of state $w(z)$. Through consistency tests, we show that current data produces results compatible with $\u039b$CDM, and that Stage IV cosmology surveys will allow GA reinforced with \\texttt{GAME} methodology to become an even more competitive tool for discriminating between different models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08GA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014GAME\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u591a\u4e2aGA\u914d\u7f6e\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5bfc\u6570\u76f8\u5173\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0bw(z)\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5b87\u5b99\u949f\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u039bCDM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u867d\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u62df\u5408\u6570\u636e\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u91cd\u6784\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5bfc\u6570\u7b49\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u5bf9\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3001\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u6613\u9677\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u65ad\uff08\u5982w(z)\uff09\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGAME\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u6784\u5efaGA\u914d\u7f6e\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u62df\u5408\u4f18\u5ea6\u4e0e\u51fd\u6570\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u8054\u5408\u5b9a\u4e49\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\uff1b\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u4e0e\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u89e3\u6790\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e73\u5747\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1GAME\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bfc\u6570\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5b87\u5b99\u949f\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u6784H(z)\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u63a8\u5f97w(z)\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u039bCDM\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u6a21\u62df\u8868\u660eStage IV\u5de1\u5929\u5c06\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u6a21\u578b\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "GAME\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86GA\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5bfc\u6570\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u91cd\u5efa\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Analytical stability conditions for these fixed points are derived, and numerical simulations reveal characteristic evolutionary patterns, such as spiral trajectories and damped oscillations in the additive mixed power-law model.

We extended the identification of these point sources up to 1.18 Mpc from the center of the cluster using data in the second module. Most of these sources are expected to be globular clusters orbiting in the deep potential well of the cluster, but also the surviving compact cores of satellite galaxies. We study the distribution of the globular clusters and compared it with the distribution of mass from a lens model derived from the same JWST data. We find a very tight correlation between the two distributions, but also some differences, including a more concentrated distribution for the globular clusters than for dark matter. We explored the possibility of using the distribution of globular clusters as a proxy for the lensing mass. We find that a simple smoothing kernel can transform the discrete distribution of point sources into a continuous two-dimensional distribution that matches well the lensing convergence. This suggests that globular clusters can be used as tracers of the dark matter distribution in other massive clusters where gravitational lensing constraints are scarce but globular clusters can be detected more easily, for instance in low redshift galaxy clusters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528JWST\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5728AS1063\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u4e2d\u5fc3\u533a\u57df\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6570\u4e07\u4e2a\u672a\u89e3\u6790\u70b9\u6e90\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u4e3a\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u548c\u536b\u661f\u661f\u7cfb\u81f4\u5bc6\u6838\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u900f\u955c\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u4f46\u66f4\u96c6\u4e2d\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u5206\u5e03\u7ecf\u5e73\u6ed1\u5904\u7406\u540e\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u6536\u655b\u5ea6\u56fe\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u793a\u8e2a\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u7ea6\u675f\u4f46\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u6613\u4e8e\u63a2\u6d4b\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\uff08\u5982\u4f4e\u7ea2\u79fb\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6709\u6548\u793a\u8e2a\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eJWST\u6df1\u573a\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9AS1063\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a9\u6a21\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u5fc3\u533a\u57df\u81f31.18 Mpc\u5185\u7684\u70b9\u6e90\uff1b\u5c06\u5176\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u540c\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u900f\u955c\u8d28\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6536\u655b\u5ea6\u56fe\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b\u5c1d\u8bd5\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u5e73\u6ed1\u6838\u5c06\u79bb\u6563\u70b9\u6e90\u5206\u5e03\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u900f\u955c\u6536\u655b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u900f\u955c\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u5448\u7d27\u5bc6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u66f4\u96c6\u4e2d\uff1b\u7ecf\u5e73\u6ed1\u540e\u7684\u70b9\u6e90\u5206\u5e03\u80fd\u826f\u597d\u590d\u73b0\u900f\u955c\u6536\u655b\u5ea6\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6709\u6548\u793a\u8e2a\u5668\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u7ea6\u675f\u7a00\u7f3a\u4f46\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u6613\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u3002"}}

Using a mock lightcone built from the Millennium I Simulation plus a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, we identified 7709 CGs when applying the standard Hickson-like criteria. For each CG, we placed 1000 random observers on a surrounding sphere and reapplied the velocity and compactness requirements to test recoverability. We also examined the variation of population and local isolation. The velocity concordance criterion shows modest sensitivity to the observer's location: 10% of CGs fail for some observers, typically groups with members with high peculiar velocities (>1000 km/s). The compactness requirement is far more fragile, as 44% of CGs are missed by most observers, and these systems are very elongated or are chance alignments in real space. Tightening selection limits reduces this dependence. Lowering the surface brightness threshold to $\u03bc\\leq 23 \\ mag/arcsec^2$ reduces the compactness dependence to 16%, while reducing the velocity limit to $\u0394V\\leq 250 \\ km/s$ lowers velocity-driven failures to less than 4%. Applying both cuts simultaneously yields up to 84% observer-independent groups, although with a substantially smaller sample. Population and isolation are affected by bright interlopers seen from different directions. While such interlopers are common, they have only a minor effect on the compactness and velocity concordance criteria; however, the local isolation is commonly broken. Observer frame effects, dominated by the compactness criterion, can significantly bias Hickson-like CG samples.

The framework combines primordial non-equilibrium chemistry, metal-line cooling, IMF-sampled stellar evolution with SN feedback, and approximate Lyman-Werner (LW) and ionizing radiation transport. We run a suite of $1c{\\rm Mpc}/h$ box simulations with different initial conditions and resolutions from $z=127$ to $z=10$. The highest gas mass and spatial resolution in the fiducial simulation reach $\\sim10\\,{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ and $\\sim4\\,{\\rm pc}$, respectively. The model successfully reproduces the UV-inferred Pop II star formation rate density (SFRD) from recent JWST observations across all initial conditions, with only minor variation driven by local halo interactions and LW irradiation.

Convergence is achieved once subhalos with $M_{\\rm subhalo}\\gtrsim 10^{6.5}\\,{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ are resolved, and the total stellar mass at $z=10$ is largely insensitive to initial conditions or the resolution considered in this work.

Consequently, the notion of black hole horizon must be defined relative to the widest propagation cone, and not with respect to the metric. We provide two theorems stating that, nevertheless, the horizon of a \\emph{stationary} black hole is null with respect to the metric, and that, in fact, all three propagation cones touch on the horizon. The conditions in these theorems allow for rotating black holes. Our theorems thereby suggest that the notion of Killing horizon, central in most discussions of black hole thermodynamics, retains its fundamental status, and that certain thermodynamic paradoxes associated with multiple propagation cones are evaded.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u56db\u7ef4\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b87\u79f0\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u6700\u4e00\u822c\u6807\u91cf-\u5f20\u91cf\u6709\u6548\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u7a33\u6001\u9ed1\u6d1e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4f20\u64ad\u9525\uff0c\u4f46\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89c6\u754c\u4ecd\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5ea6\u89c4\u662f\u7c7b\u5149\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u6709\u4f20\u64ad\u9525\u5728\u89c6\u754c\u5904\u76f8\u5207\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4f20\u64ad\u9525\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ea6\u89c4\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89c6\u754c\u6982\u5ff5\u53d7\u5230\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u89c6\u754c\u5b9a\u4e49\u53ca\u5176\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u56db\u7ef4\u5b87\u79f0\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6807\u91cf-\u5f20\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u7a33\u6001\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89c6\u754c\u51e0\u4f55\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9a\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7a33\u6001\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u89c6\u754c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5ea6\u89c4\u662f\u7c7b\u5149\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u4f20\u64ad\u9525\u5728\u89c6\u754c\u5904\u76f8\u4e92\u63a5\u89e6\uff1b\u8be5\u7ed3\u8bba\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5305\u62ec\u65cb\u8f6c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u5185\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u60c5\u5f62\u3002", "conclusion": "Killing\u89c6\u754c\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u591a\u4f20\u64ad\u9525\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u4f9d\u7136\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6096\u8bba\u5f97\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\uff0c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u5f97\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u3002"}}

Accretion of dwarf galaxies also occurred over the Galaxy's lifetime, merging with the original bulge. In this work, we constrain the metal-rich stars of the earliest spheroidal bulge. To study the oldest bulge stars, distributed in a spheroid, we applied kinematical and dynamical criteria in the metal-rich range [Fe/H] > -0.8. This complements our previous analysis of a symmetric sample with [Fe/H] < -0.8. We derived individual abundances through spectral synthesis for C, N, O, Al, P, S, K, Mn, and Ce using stellar parameters from APOGEE DR17, and compared the results with literature data and chemical-evolution models. The alpha elements Mg, Si, and Ca, and iron-peak elements V, Cr, Co, and Ni follow the expected trends relative to the models. Mn shows secondary behaviour. S and K display significant star-to-star scatter but remain broadly compatible with predictions. Phosphorus and cerium show an excess around [Fe/H] $\\sim$ -0.7, more pronounced than in the metal-poor sample, suggesting a distinctive signature of the earliest bulge population. Diagrams of [Mg/Mn] versus [Al/Fe] and [Ni/Fe] versus [(C+N)/O] indicate an in situ origin for most stars.

Chirp masses are typically measured well, with the smallest fractional uncertainty being $2%$ at the $90%$ credible level. Spins, on the other hand, are poorly constrained: the median of the best-measured spin component of the population, the effective spin, is $\u03c7_{\\rm eff}=0.04$, with a typical $90%$ credible uncertainty of $\u0394\u03c7_{\\rm eff}=0.44$. The large majority -- $90%$ of the observed black holes -- are consistent with spin magnitudes $\u03c7<0.57$ and are weakly aligned with the orbits. At $90%$ credibility, the peaks of the inferred posteriors for spin magnitude are found to lie in the range $0.01$--$0.23$.\n  We show that this ``near-zero spins'' conclusion may be prior-driven, and that uniform-in-magnitude spin priors lead to under-exploration of the moderate-to-high spin region of parameter space. Adopting a physically agnostic prior that is uniform in spin-vector configuration space (i.e., spin states uniform within a unit sphere) yields similar constraints on $\u03c7_{\\rm eff}$, but substantially different spin-magnitude inferences than GWTC-4.0. The resulting shift in spins directly impacts tests of general relativity, constraints on near-extremal Kerr remnants, and astrophysical conclusions, including diagnostics of formation channels and hierarchical growth. In short, the data do not require vanishing spins -- the prior does, and accounting for this is essential for robust GR tests and population inferences.", "AI": {"tldr": "GWTC-4.0\u62a5\u544a\u4e86153\u4e2a\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5e76\u5408\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u65cb\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u7ed3\u8bba\u53ef\u80fd\u7531\u5148\u9a8c\u9009\u62e9\u5bfc\u81f4\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7acb\u7684\u7403\u9762\u5747\u5300\u81ea\u65cb\u5148\u9a8c\u540e\uff0c\u81ea\u65cb\u5927\u5c0f\u63a8\u65ad\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u68c0\u9a8c\u548c\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d28\u7591GWTC-4.0\u4e2d\u2018\u9ed1\u6d1e\u81ea\u65cb\u8fd1\u96f6\u2019\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u5426\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u7531\u4e0d\u6070\u5f53\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u5148\u9a8c\uff08uniform-in-magnitude\uff09\u6240\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u548c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u79cd\u81ea\u65cb\u5148\u9a8c\uff1aGWTC-4.0\u91c7\u7528\u7684uniform-in-magnitude\u5148\u9a8c vs. \u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u66f4\u4e2d\u7acb\u7684uniform-in-spin-vector\uff08\u5355\u4f4d\u7403\u5185\u5747\u5300\uff09\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u65cb\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u03c7_eff\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u5927\u5c0f\u03c7\uff09\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u8bba\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "uniform-in-spin-vector\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0b\uff0c\u03c7_eff\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0eGWTC-4.0\u76f8\u8fd1\uff08\u4e2d\u4f4d\u65700.04\uff0c\u0394\u03c7_eff\u22480.44\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u81ea\u65cb\u5927\u5c0f\u03c7\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5cf0\u503c\u79fb\u81f3\u66f4\u9ad8\u8303\u56f4\uff08\u539f\u4e3a0.01\u20130.23\uff0c\u65b0\u63a8\u65ad\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff09\uff0c90%\u7f6e\u4fe1\u4e0b\u03c7<0.57\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u66f4\u591a\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5141\u8bb8\u4e2d\u9ad8\u81ea\u65cb\uff1b\u8fd9\u6539\u53d8\u4e86GR\u68c0\u9a8c\u3001\u6781\u503c\u514b\u5c14\u6b8b\u4f59\u9ed1\u6d1e\u9650\u5236\u53ca\u5f62\u6210\u901a\u9053\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "\u2018\u8fd1\u96f6\u81ea\u65cb\u2019\u5e76\u975e\u6570\u636e\u5f3a\u652f\u6301\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5148\u9a8c\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u7684\u7403\u9762\u5747\u5300\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u83b7\u5f97\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u65ad\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

We demonstrate that by introducing the boundary term C, a non-metricity scalar-tensor theory can recover Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (STEGR) in the Einstein frame. Motivated by this, we propose a novel gravity model where a scalar field couples nonminimally to both the non-metricity scalar Q and the boundary term C. We focus in the cosmological scenario where we present the covariant formulation and a unified autonomous system framework that treats generic affine-connection choices, including coincident and non-coincident gauges, on an equal footing. Our dynamical analysis across three connection branches reveals standard thermal histories and stable de Sitter attractors. These results show that boundary-term couplings provide a well-posed, geometrically flexible route to addressing late-time cosmic acceleration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6807\u91cf-\u5f20\u91cf\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u975e\u6700\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u5230\u975e\u5ea6\u89c4\u6027\u6807\u91cfQ\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u9879C\uff0c\u4f7f\u975e\u5ea6\u89c4\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u5728\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u5e27\u4e2d\u6062\u590dSTEGR\uff1b\u5e76\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u81ea\u6cbb\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u91cd\u73b0\u6807\u51c6\u70ed\u5386\u53f2\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5fb7\u897f\u7279\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\uff0c\u4e3a\u665a\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u52a0\u901f\u63d0\u4f9b\u51e0\u4f55\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u826f\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u975e\u5ea6\u89c4\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u901a\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u5f62\u53d8\u6362\u6062\u590d\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\uff0c\u800c\u4f5c\u8005\u53d7\u6b64\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8fb9\u754c\u9879C\uff0c\u4f7f\u975e\u5ea6\u89c4\u6027\u6807\u91cf-\u5f20\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u5e27\u4e2d\u6062\u590dSTEGR\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u4eff\u5c04\u8054\u7edc\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u91cd\u5408\u4e0e\u975e\u91cd\u5408\u89c4\u8303\uff09\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8fb9\u754c\u9879C\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u540c\u65f6\u975e\u6700\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u4e8e\u975e\u5ea6\u89c4\u6027\u6807\u91cfQ\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u9879C\u7684\u6807\u91cf-\u5f20\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u534f\u53d8\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5c55\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u81ea\u6cbb\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u4eff\u5c04\u8054\u7edc\u5206\u652f\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u8054\u7edc\u5206\u652f\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u6062\u590dSTEGR\uff1b\u81ea\u6cbb\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5b58\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u70ed\u5386\u53f2\u6f14\u5316\u53ca\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5fb7\u897f\u7279\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\uff1b\u8868\u660e\u8fb9\u754c\u9879\u8026\u5408\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u51e0\u4f55\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u6570\u5b66\u826f\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u665a\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u52a0\u901f\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fb9\u754c\u9879C\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u5ea6\u89c4\u6027\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u5411\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7b49\u4ef7\u5f62\u5f0f\uff08STEGR\uff09\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u89e3\u91ca\u665a\u671f\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u575a\u5b9e\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

We investigate a model whereby ORCs are synchrotron-emitting vortex rings formed by the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) when a shock interacts with a low-density fossil radio lobe in the intergalactic medium using 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. These rings initially exhibit oscillatory behavior that damps over time. We implement a new method to model Inverse-Compton cooling and synchrotron cooling at high frequencies in a scale-free manner, enabling us to test a wide range of model parameters against the observational constraints. We find that shock strengths of Mach 2-4 are consistent with the data, as expected in accretion, merger-driven, or active galactic nuclei-driven shocks. We find that the initial size of the bubbles required to explain the rings ranges from 140 to 250 kpc, with initial energy in the bubble of order $10^{57}-10^{59}$ erg, consistent with fossil lobes inflated by moderately powerful radio galaxies. Derived ambient pressures and densities place ORCs in low density environments, such as the outskirts of galaxy groups with ages of order 70-200 Myr. Our synthetic radio maps match the polarization properties of ORC1 and predict a dependency of the tangential magnetic field angle on the aspect ratio of ORCs. A key distinguishing trait of the RMI-driven vortex ring model is that it does not require the ORC to be centered on its host galaxy and is therefore redshift agnostic.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes that Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) are synchrotron-emitting vortex rings formed via the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability when a shock interacts with a low-density fossil radio lobe; 3D MHD simulations with novel cooling modeling support this, matching observed properties and implying ORCs originate in low-density group outskirts, independent of host galaxy redshift.", "motivation": "The physical nature and origins of Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) remain unclear, prompting investigation into a new model involving shock-induced vortex rings from fossil radio lobes.", "method": "The authors use 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to model synchrotron-emitting vortex rings formed by the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) when a shock interacts with a low-density fossil radio lobe.

Using the junction method and asymptotic expansions of Hankel functions, we derive accurate asymptotic expressions for the time evolution of mode functions and the resulting power spectrum, based on three systematic rules for identifying the dominant terms across transitions. Our results reveal that a finite dip of the final power spectrum arises from the cancellation between two growing modes within the linear perturbation theory, rather than between constant and growing terms as previously suggested. We also provide analytical descriptions of the amplitude enhancement and oscillatory features in the linear power spectrum, in agreement with numerical computations.

Our model maintains high performance on synthetic mixtures of unseen molecules. Feature importance analysis reveals that PAH size diagnostics are not universal but highly charge-dependent; while neutral size is traced mainly by C-H stretching modes, sizing ionized species also relies on the morphology of 6-8 micron C-C complexes, with the 12.5 micron feature emerging as a robust cross-charge tracer.

By decomposing the broad and narrow components of the Balmer emission lines, we investigate the connection between line emission and UV/optical continua for the LRD population. We find that the broad H$\u03b1$ luminosity strongly correlates with the optical continuum (but not with the UV), indicating a common AGN origin for both. In contrast, the [O III] line strength is correlated with the UV continuum rather than the optical. Using the width and luminosity of the broad H$\u03b1$ line, we estimate central black hole masses of $10^6-10^8 M_{\\odot}$ accreting at high Eddington ratios, consistent with an early ($\u03bb_{\\rm Edd} \\sim 0.6$), rapid-growth phase of AGN evolution. Assuming a constant mass accretion rate in the framework of slim-disk models, we infer growth timescales of $\\sim 10^5-10^7\\rm yr$, and suggest LRDs may evolve into narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. Upper limits from our spectra indicate that LRDs exhibit intrinsically weak optical Fe II emission compared to typical AGN. To simultaneously account for the inferred broad-line region size and observed luminosity, we propose a \"Clumpy Envelope\" model in which the optical emission arises from an extended, clumpy gas with a characteristic radius of tens of light-days. The diversity in observed optical continuum shapes can be explained by radial temperature gradients and self-absorption effects within this structure.

Shocks from interacting components encode the temperature and density distribution, offering a direct probe of the earliest evolution history. However, interferometric observations characterizing warm envelopes using high-excitation lines remain scarce. We present ALMA Band 9 observations of the Taurus dense core MC 27/L1521F, which hosts a Class 0 protostar, targeting the CO($J$=6-5) line at an angular resolution of $\\sim$2\\arcsec\\ ($\\approx$300 au). We detect an off-centered ring-like structure with a diameter of $\\sim$1000 au that was not identifiable in previous low-$J$ CO data, where emission close to the systemic velocity is strongly affected by optical depth. The ring shows a typical peak brightness temperature of $\\sim$3 K at our resolution. Excitation considerations indicate that the detected CO($J$=6-5) emission likely arises from relatively warm ($T \\gtrsim 20$ K) and dense ($n({\\rm H_2}) \\gtrsim 10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) gas embedded within the surrounding cold, dense core. The morphology and kinematics suggest an energetic and localized shock-heating event, potentially linked to dynamical gas--magnetic-field interactions in the earliest protostellar phase.

The code integrates three key components: (1) Kamelung, a 1D hydrodynamics module simulating gravitational collapse up to first hydrostatic core (FHSC) formation followed by an accretion of envelope onto a young star; (2) Presta, a chemical evolution module post-processing density and temperature profiles to compute time-dependent molecular abundances; and (3) Uran(IA), a radiative transfer module generating synthetic molecular line spectra. We apply Gorynych to compare low-mass (5 Msun) and high-mass (50 Msun) cores, finding that their dynamical evolution is remarkably similar, with differences primarily in spatial scaling. Chemical evolution reveals sharp abundance changes during the FHSC transition, particularly for CO, H2O, and HCO+, though pre-collapse chemical initialization has minimal impact on most species. Spectral maps of 13CO(2-1), HCO+(3-2), and H2O(110--101) lines show distinct kinematic signatures of infall and depletion, with high-mass cores exhibiting spatially extended emission. Our results highlight Gorynych's utility to couple theoretical collapse models and observations, providing a framework to diagnose core evolution and initial conditions from molecular line data.", "AI": {"tldr": "PrestaLine: Gorynych \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u5b50\u4e91\u6838\u4ece\u539f\u6052\u661f\u9636\u6bb5\u5230\u539f\u6052\u661f\u5438\u79ef\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6d41\u4f53\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e91\u6838\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u8026\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u574d\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u8bca\u65ad\u4e91\u6838\u6f14\u5316\u53ca\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86 PrestaLine: Gorynych \u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6574\u5408 Kamelung\uff081D \u6d41\u4f53\u529b\u5b66\uff09\u3001Presta\uff08\u5316\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\uff09\u548c Uran(IA)\uff08\u8f90\u5c04\u8f6c\u79fb\uff09\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5bf9 5 \u548c 50 \u500d\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4e91\u6838\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e91\u6838\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4ec5\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\uff1bFHSC \u8f6c\u53d8\u671f\u95f4 CO\u3001H2O\u3001HCO+ \u7b49\u5206\u5b50\u4e30\u5ea6\u53d1\u751f\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u663e\u793a\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5185\u843d\u548c\u8017\u5c3d\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e91\u6838\u8f90\u5c04\u66f4\u5ef6\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "Gorynych \u6709\u6548\u8fde\u63a5\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5206\u5b50\u8c31\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u53cd\u6f14\u4e91\u6838\u6f14\u5316\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u3002"}}

Two demographic trends are already apparent: (i) all events occur in massive, early-type parent galaxies with stellar masses $10.8 \\lesssim \\log_{10}(M_\\star/M_\\odot) \\lesssim 11.1$; and (ii) events at larger halo-centric radii ($R_{\\rm TDE}/R_{200}$) are associated with dwarf satellites ($M_\\star \\sim 10^7 M_\\odot$), while those closer to halo centers lack detected stellar counterparts. Using results from the \\texttt{ROMULUS} cosmological simulation, we show that both trends naturally arise from hierarchical galaxy formation.

We further show that ii), i.e., the observed link between detection of stellar counterparts and $R_{\\rm TDE}/R_{200}$, is also expected from tidal stripping.

We present a self-consistent direct method based on multiple OIII]1661,66) and [OIII] ($\u03bb$4363, and $\u03bb$5007) transitions to characterize the physical conditions of the high-ionization zone. This new approach is insensitive to a wide range of n$_{\\rm e}$ due to the high critical densities of the OIII] and [OIII] transitions. Applying this technique to six galaxies at z=5-9, we find electron densities up to n$_{\\rm e}$$\\sim 3\\times 10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$ and temperatures of T$_{\\rm e}$ $\\sim 20,000$ K in systems at $z>6$. Accounting for these self-consistent densities changes the derived T$_{\\rm e}$ and modifies the inferred metallicities by up to 0.29 dex relative to previous estimates. We discuss the reported N/O overabundances in the high-$z$ galaxies from our sample, which arise entirely from the high N$^{3+}$/H$^{+}$ values inferred from NIV] lines. We point out that a T$_{\\rm e}$-stratification, in which the N$^{3+}$ zone has a slightly higher T$_{\\rm e}$ than T$_{\\rm e}$([OIII]), could substantially reduce the inferred N/O. Quantitatively, if T$_{\\rm e}$(N$^{3+}$) were 10\\% higher than T$_{\\rm e}$([OIII]), this could induce a systematic overestimation of N$^{3+}$/O$^{2+}$ of nearly 50\\%. Classical N/O diagnostics such as N$^{+}$/O$^{+}$, due to their critical densities, can significantly impact the inferred N/O abundance in the presence of high-density gas, whereas N$^{2+}$/O$^{2+}$ place these galaxies closer to $z\\sim0$ systems in the N/O-O/H plane.

Data url will be released upon acceptance", "summary": "Post-starburst (PSB) galaxies, having recently experienced a starburst followed by rapid quenching, are excellent laboratories to probe physical mechanisms that drive starbursts and shutting down of star formation. Integral-field spectroscopy reveals the galaxies' spatially-resolved properties, where observed directional patterns can be linked to the galaxies' past evolution. We measure the resolved star-formation histories (SFHs), stellar metallicity evolution and dust properties of three local PSBs from the MaNGA survey, down to $0.5$\" resolution ($\\sim0.3\\,$kpc) using a hierarchical Bayesian model. Local parameters were constrained simultaneously with parameters describing spatial trends. We found that all three galaxies first experienced an outer, weaker and slower quenching starburst, followed by a central, stronger and faster quenching starburst that peaked $\\sim 1\\,$Gyr after the first. The central starbursts induced a significantly stronger rise in stellar metallicity compared to the outer starbursts. These results are consistent with the effects of a recent gas-rich (wet) merger, where the first pericentre passage triggered starbursts in the outer regions, while the later coalescence triggers a stronger centralised starburst. We find non-axisymmetric features in the maps of burst mass fraction and dust attenuation in all galaxies, which could be caused by tidal effects during the recent merger. Comparisons with literature binary merger simulations suggests that the galaxies' rapid quenching was driven by gas consumption and the stabilisation against gas gravitational collapse by a growing spheroid, while AGN feedback was not necessarily a primary cause.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528MaNGA\u5de1\u5929\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u672c\u5730\u540e\u661f\u66b4\uff08PSB\uff09\u661f\u7cfb\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u5c18\u57c3\u6027\u8d28\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u661f\u66b4\uff1a\u5148\u4e3a\u5916\u533a\u8f83\u5f31\u8f83\u6162\uff0c\u540e\u4e3a\u5185\u533a\u66f4\u5f3a\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8fd1\u671f\u6c14\u4f53\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5e76\u5408\u89e6\u53d1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5feb\u901f\u7184\u706b\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u6c14\u4f53\u8017\u5c3d\u4e0e\u7403\u72b6\u6210\u5206\u589e\u957f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u584c\u7f29\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u975eAGN\u53cd\u9988\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u540e\u661f\u66b4\uff08PSB\uff09\u661f\u7cfb\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u661f\u66b4\u89e6\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u5feb\u901f\u7184\u706b\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\uff1b\u79ef\u5206\u573a\u5149\u8c31\u53ef\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u6f14\u5316\u5386\u53f2\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eMaNGA\u5de1\u5929\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728~0.3 kpc\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u62df\u5408\u4e09\u4e2a\u672c\u5730PSB\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u5c40\u57df\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u8d8b\u52bf\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u53cd\u6f14\u5176\u5206\u8fa8\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\u3001\u6052\u661f\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u6f14\u5316\u53ca\u5c18\u57c3\u8870\u51cf\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u661f\u7cfb\u5747\u5448\u73b0\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u661f\u66b4\uff1a\u5148\u4e3a\u5916\u533a\u8f83\u5f31\u3001\u8f83\u6162\u7684\u7184\u706b\u661f\u66b4\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u7ea61 Gyr\u5185\u5728\u4e2d\u5fc3\u53d1\u751f\u66f4\u5f3a\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u7184\u706b\u661f\u66b4\uff1b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u661f\u66b4\u5f15\u53d1\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\uff1bburst\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u5c18\u57c3\u8870\u51cf\u56fe\u4e2d\u5747\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u6f6e\u6c50\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u4e0e\u5e76\u5408\u6a21\u62df\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u7184\u706b\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u6c14\u4f53\u8017\u5c3d\u53ca\u589e\u957f\u7684\u7403\u72b6\u6210\u5206\u6291\u5236\u6c14\u4f53\u5f15\u529b\u584c\u7f29\u6240\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u8fd1\u671f\u6c14\u4f53\u4e30\u5bcc\uff08\u6e7f\uff09\u5e76\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u8fd1\u5fc3\u70b9\u7ecf\u8fc7\u89e6\u53d1\u5916\u533a\u661f\u66b4\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u5e76\u5408\u89e6\u53d1\u5f3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u661f\u66b4\uff1b\u7184\u706b\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u661f\u7cfb\u81ea\u8eab\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\uff08\u6c14\u4f53\u6d88\u8017+\u7403\u72b6\u6210\u5206\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\uff09\u4e3a\u4e3b\uff0cAGN\u53cd\u9988\u5e76\u975e\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u3002"}}

II. impact of the rotational energy difference between adsorbed ortho-H$_2$ and para-H$_2$ and implication to deuterium fractionation chemistry", "comment": "18 pages, 9 Figures, Accepted in ApJ", "summary": "We investigate how the H$_2$ ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) and dueterium fractionation in star-forming regions are affected by nuclear spin conversion (NSC) on dust grains. Particular focus is placed on the rotational energy difference between ortho-H$_2$ (o-H$_2$) and para-H$_2$ (p-H$_2$) on grain surfaces. While the ground state of o-H$_2$ has a higher rotational energy than that of p-H$_2$ by 170.5 K in the gas phase, this energy difference is expected to become smaller on solid surfaces, where interactions between the surface and adsorbed H$_2$ molecules affect their rotational motion. A previous study by Furuya et al. (2019) developed a rigorous formulation of the rate for the temporal variation of the H$_2$ OPR via the NSC on grains, assuming that adsorbed o-H$_2$ has higher rotational energy than adsorbed p-H$_2$ by 170.5 K, as in the gas phase. In this work, we relax the assumption and re-evaluate the rate, varying the rotational energy difference between their ground states. The re-evaluated rate is incorporated into a gas-ice astrochemical model to study the evolution of the H$_2$ OPR and the deuterium fractionation in prestellar cores and the outer, cold regions of protostellar envelopes. The inclusion of the NSC on grains reduces the timescale of the H2 OPR evolution and thus the deuterium fractionation, at densities of >10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$ and temperatures of <14-16 K (depending on the rotational energy difference), when the ionization rate of H$_2$ is 10$^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5c18\u57c3\u9897\u7c92\u8868\u9762\u6838\u81ea\u65cb\u8f6c\u6362\uff08NSC\uff09\u5bf9H\u2082\u6b63-\u4ef2\u6bd4\uff08OPR\uff09\u548c\u6c18\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20\u5206\u998f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8003\u5bdf\u5438\u9644\u6001o-H\u2082\u4e0ep-H\u2082\u57fa\u6001\u65cb\u8f6c\u80fd\u5dee\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u4e86NSC\u901f\u7387\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u7eb3\u5165\u6c14-\u51b0\u5316\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0NSC\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u77edOPR\u6f14\u5316\u53ca\u6c18\u5206\u998f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u5047\u8bbe\u5438\u9644\u6001H\u2082\u7684\u6b63-\u4ef2\u65cb\u8f6c\u80fd\u5dee\u4e0e\u6c14\u76f8\u76f8\u540c\uff08170.5 K\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5728\u5c18\u57c3\u8868\u9762\u8be5\u80fd\u5dee\u53ef\u80fd\u51cf\u5c0f\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u653e\u677e\u8be5\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30NSC\u5bf9\u661f\u9645\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2dH\u2082 OPR\u548c\u6c18\u5206\u998f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4fee\u6b63Furuya et al.
