The construction is motivated by an $E_6\\times E_6$ framework in which $SU(3)_R\\rightarrow SU(2)_R\\times U(1)_{Y'}\\rightarrow U(1)_{\\rm dem}$, leaving a healthy repulsive $U(1)_{\\rm dem}$ interaction whose charge is the square-root mass label. Gravity itself arises from the $SU(2)_R$ connection via a Plebanski/MacDowell--Mansouri mechanism, yielding an emergent tetrad and the Einstein--Hilbert action. MOND is implemented by an infrared (IR) metric deformation $ΔS_{\\rm IR}[g]$ that is UV-vanishing (so GR is recovered) while its deep-MOND/static limit is fixed by a symmetry principle: in three spatial dimensions, the deep-MOND action is conformally invariant with a 10-parameter group isomorphic to $SO(4,1)$ (the de Sitter group). The single MOND acceleration scale is set by a de Sitter radius selected dynamically in the IR, $a_0=c^2/(ξ\\,\\ell_{\\rm dS})$ with $ξ={ O}(1)$ fixed by matching to the static limit. MOND resides in perturbations and quasistatic systems; the homogeneous FRW background is controlled by the IR vacuum kinematics rather than an ad hoc cosmological constant."}

Could this crowding relate directly to the Davies phase transition point at $a=0.68125$ from black hole thermodynamics? I argue that a necessary challenge for such a connection requires a consistent application of the thermodynamic fluctuation theory that follows from black hole thermodynamics (BHT). Specifically, necessary are a correct choice of fluctuating variables, as well as thermal equilibrium between the event horizon at the Hawking temperature $\\sim μK$ and the outside universe $\\sim 3 K$. I show that the former requirement follows in straightforward fashion from the BHT of the Kerr model, while the later requires an accretion disk following the Novikov-Thorne accretion disk model.

We start our investigation with the Granda-Oliveros (GO) cutoff, i.e., $L=(γH^{2}+δ\\dot{H})^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$, and highlight the range of allowed $α$ (Lévy's index) values for which big, little and pseudo rip can occur. In particular, we highlight the occurrence of a big rip for fractional values of the Lévy's index in the allowed range $1<α\\leq2$. Moreover, we conclude that the occurrence of a pseudo-rip requires Lévy's index to be $α>2$. Therefore, we reject the possibility of pseudo-rip within the GO cutoff. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the occurrence of the little rip in FHDE equipped with a GO cutoff is rather contrived and requires a specific functional form of the IR cutoff $L\\sim(γH^{2}+g(H))^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$, which belongs to a larger class of Nojiri-Odintsov (NO) cutoffs. To extend our perspective beyond the GO cutoff, we investigate the interacting FHDE framework equipped with the Hubble cutoff, i.e., $L=H^{-1}$, in developing an ansatz-based approach to the little and pseudo-rip singularities as they fail to appear in the GO cutoff. Within this approach, we invoke the expression of the Hubble parameter, $H(t)$, which corresponds to the little and pseudo-rip, into the cosmological parameters such as the Equation of State (EoS) and Squared Sound Speed (SSS) as a function of cosmic time $t$. We produce numerical plots of these parameters in both linear and non-linear $Q$ regimes, which supplement our theoretical findings. In summary, our results highlight the occurrence of little and pseudo-rip singularities within a Hubble cutoff for a non-linear $Q$ term within the FHDE framework."}

This condition is not compatible with the simultaneous fulfillment of Hayward's unified gravitational first law and the fundamental thermodynamic equation of the apparent horizon. To solve this problem, we introduce an alternative formulation in which the cosmological horizon is modeled as a quasi-homogeneous thermodynamic system. We apply this approach to the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe under quantum gravity corrections encoded by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), promote the deformation parameter to a thermodynamic variable, and obtain a consistent thermodynamic description without relying on the usual pressure-volume interpretation. Using Geometrothermodynamics (GTD), we show that fluctuations of the GUP parameter can induce phase transitions closely resembling those of black hole configurations. Finally, we perform a numerical analysis of the behavior of the GTD scalar curvature near the phase transition point, where we find a scaling behavior characterized by the critical exponent close to 1, independently of the dimension of the equilibrium space. This reveals that quantum gravity corrections not only modify the thermodynamic consistency of cosmological models but also strengthen the notion of thermodynamic universality across gravitational systems. Our findings confirm GTD as a powerful geometric tool to unveil the emergent thermodynamic microstructure of spacetime."}

We study a series of response models to investigate the formation of specific morphological features in the central 1 kpc region of the gas component in barred spiral galaxies.\n  Aims. We aim to understand how structures, such as nuclear rings and spirals, form by varying the parameters of a general gravitational potential and gas properties. Our goal is to determine how much the shape of these structures is driven by the orbital dynamics of the models compared to the influence of the hydrodynamics of the gas. In particular, we examine the effects of the bar strength, bar shape, pattern speed, and central density, as well as their mutual interdependence.\n  Methods. We modeled the gas flow using hydrodynamical simulations run with the Eulerian RAMSES code. The underlying gravitational potential was a two-dimensional Ferrers bar and the gas was considered to be isothermal. Alongside analyzing the gas response to the imposed gravitational potentials, we carried out orbital studies for all models. This involved assessing the shapes and stability of periodic orbits and analyzing the distribution of regular versus chaotic regions within the systems.\n  Results. The parameters of the gravitational potential alone are insufficient to accurately predict the gas dynamics in a system. The morphology of the gaseous response varies substantially with changes in sound speed, emphasizing the fundamental role of hydrodynamic processes in determining the structure of the gas within the central region. We identify the factors that affect the morphology of nuclear rings and trailing and leading nuclear spirals. The best alignment between our models and structures observed in local barred galaxies is achieved by assuming a sound speed of $c_s=20\\,\\rm{km\\,s^{-1}}$."}

To resolve this amplitude tension, we introduce the Radiative SIDM Dilution framework.We explain the observed spectrum emerges as a hybrid signal by an astrophysical floor, dynamically suppressed by the cored halos of Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM),and a dominant cosmological peak generated during a supercooled phase transition in the dark sector.

It is known that adding a weak perturbation to the radial potential can strongly disrupt the spectrum of quasinormal modes and Regge poles of a black hole spacetime. Here we examine the effect of (weak or strong) localised delta-function perturbations on the resonant spectra of spherically-symmetric systems, to address fundamental questions around linear and non-linear spectral stability. We examine two cases: the Nariai spacetime with a Poschl-Teller potential and the Schwarzschild spacetime. We show that, in either case, the spectrum deforms in a smooth and continuous manner as the position and strength of the perturbation is varied. As the strength of the perturbation is increased, resonances migrate along trajectories in the complex plane which ultimately tend towards attracting points determined by a hard-wall scenario. However, for weak perturbations the trajectory near the unperturbed resonance is typically strongly influenced by a set of repelling points which, for perturbations far from the system, lie very close to the unperturbed resonances; hence there arises a non-linear instability (i.e. the failure of a linearised approximation). Taking a dynamical systems perspective, the sets of attracting and repelling spectral points follow their own trajectories as the position of the perturbation is varied, and these are tracked and understood."}

Such conditions are typically encountered in a zone between the 4:1 resonance and corotation. The purpose of our study is to understand the gaseous flow in the aforementioned environment and trace the morphology of the shocks that form. We use two conceptually different hydrodynamic schemes for our calculations, namely, the mesh-free Lagrangian SPH method and the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES. This allows us to compare responses by means of the two algorithms. We find that the big loops of the orbits, mainly belonging to the x1 stable periodic orbits, do not help the shock loci to approach corotation. They deviate away from the regions occupied by the loops, bypass them and form extensions at an angle with the straight-line shocks. Roughly at the distance from the center at which we start to observe the big loops, we find characteristic \"tails\" of dense gas streaming towards the straight-line shocks. The two codes give complementary information for understanding the hydrodynamics of the models."}

Motivated by the Trans-Planckian problem and potential non-canonical dynamics in the early Universe, we introduce a generalized Sasaki-Mukhanov equation characterized by a time-dependent correction term, parameterized by a coupling constant f. Unlike the standard slow-roll approximation, we derive the exact analytical solutions for the mode functions in terms of Whittaker functions, ensuring a precise treatment of the mode evolution across the horizon. We compute the resulting primordial scalar power spectrum, which exhibits scale-dependent oscillatory modulations and a distinct suppression of power at low multipoles. We numerically implement this modified framework within the Cobaya Bayesian inference engine. Utilizing the latest Planck 2018 temperature and polarization likelihoods combined with high-resolution data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6, we perform a robust Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) analysis. Our results place stringent constraints on the modification parameter, |f| <= 10^-4, at a 95% confidence level. However, we find intriguing hints that the generalized model provides a better fit to the low-l CMB spectrum compared to the standard LambdaCDM model, effectively alleviating the low-quadrupole anomaly without compromising the fit at smaller scales.

The abundance pattern is determined by both galaxy evolution and SMS pollution, but so far, simple one-zone models have been used. Using a galaxy formation simulation, we tested the SMS scenario. We used a cosmological zoom-in simulation that includes chemical evolution driven by rotating massive stars (Wolf-Rayet stars), supernovae, and asymptotic giant branch stars. As a post-process, we assumed the formation of an SMS with a mass between $10^3$ and $10^5$ $M_\\odot$ and investigated the contribution of its ejecta to the abundance pattern. The N/O ratio was enhanced by the SMS ejecta, and the abundance pattern of GN-z11, including carbon-to-oxygen and oxygen-to-hydrogen ratios, was reproduced by our SMS pollution model if the pollution mass fraction ranges within 10-30 per cent. Such a pollution fraction can be realized when the gas ionized by the SMS is polluted, and the gas density is $10^4$-$10^5$ cm$^{-3}$ assuming a Strömgren sphere.

Galaxy 2-point correlation function modelling in redshift space", "comment": "29 pages, 13 figures, abstract abridged for arxiv submission", "summary": "The Euclid satellite will measure spectroscopic redshifts for tens of millions of emission-line galaxies. In the context of Stage-IV surveys, the 3-dimensional clustering of galaxies plays a key role in providing cosmological constraints. In this paper, we conduct a model comparison for the multipole moments of the galaxy 2-point correlation function (2PCF) in redshift space. We test state-of-the-art models, in particular the effective field theory of large-scale structure (EFT), one based on the velocity difference generating function (VDG$_{\\infty}$), and different variants of Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT) models, such as convolutional LPT (CLPT) and its effective-field-theory extension (CLEFT). We analyse the first three even multipoles of the 2PCF in the Flagship 1 simulation, which consists of four snapshots at $z\\in\\{0.9,1.2,1.5,1.8\\}$. We study both template-fitting and full-shape approaches and find that with the template-fitting approach, only the VDG$_{\\infty}$ model is able to reach a minimum fitting scale of $s_{\\rm min}=20\\,h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$ at $z=0.9$ without biasing the recovered parameters. Indeed, the EFT model becomes inaccurate already at $s_{\\rm min}=30\\,h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$. Conversely, in the full-shape analysis, the CLEFT and VDG$_{\\infty}$ models perform similarly well, but only the CLEFT model can reach $s_{\\rm min}=20\\,h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$ while the VDG$_{\\infty}$ model is unbiased down to $s_{\\rm min}=25\\,h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$ at the lowest redshift. Overall, in order to achieve the accuracy required by Euclid, non-perturbative modelling such as in the VDG$_{\\infty}$ or CLEFT models should be considered. At $z=1.8$, the CLPT model is sufficient to describe the data with high figure of merit. This comparison selects baseline models that perform best in ideal conditions and sets the stage for an optimal analysis of Euclid data in configuration space."}

In this paper, we compute the quantum scalar fields and stress tensor in boson star spacetimes within the framework of semiclassical gravity. Divergences are regularized using Pauli-Villars fields, and accurate numerical results are obtained through spectral methods. Employing coherent states enables a direct comparison between the classical part of the stress tensor and the quantum fluctuation. Our results indicate that strong spacetime curvature is the primary source of large quantum effects. The renormalized quantum energy density is mostly positive but the radial pressure is negative, suggesting that classical boson star solutions require modification once quantum effects are included. Moreover, in regimes of large curvature, the quantum fluctuations can constitute a significant fraction of the total stress tensor. The methods developed here can be generalized to other compact objects and used to study their response to quantum corrections."}

Extensive surveys like SDSS cover AGN in the Northern Sky, but the equivalent coverage in the Southern Sky remains limited.

Current constraints leave the asteroid-mass window the only possible one for PBH to account for all the dark matter, which can only be probed indirectly by the scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) sourced by the curvature perturbation which forms PBH. In this work, we explore the capabilities of future space-based gravitational wave detectors, including LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, to constrain such induced GWs as well as the PBH abundance. We systematically account for the width of the primordial curvature power spectrum, and find that the asteroid-mass window can be fully probed by all three space-based interferometers.

The resulting effective action is mapped to a relativistic quantum field theory on a dispersive (or rainbow) cosmological spacetime which has a superluminal Corley-Jacobson dispersion relation. Time-dependent changes of the s-wave scattering length to quantum-simulate cosmological particle production are accompanied by a time-dependent healing length that can be interpreted as an analog Planck length in the comoving frame. Non-adiabatic transitions acquire a dispersive character, which is thoroughly discussed. The framework is applied to exponentially expanding or power-law contracting $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetimes which are known to produce scale-invariant cosmological power spectra. The sensitivity of these scenarios to the time-dependence of the Bogoliubov dispersion is investigated: We find a violation of scale-invariance via analytically trackable Transplanckian damping effects if the cut-off scale is not well separated from the horizon-crossing scale. In case of the exponential expansion, these damping effects remarkably settle and converge to another scale-invariant plateau in the far ultraviolet regime where non-adiabatic transitions are suppressed by the high dispersion. The developed framework enables quantitative access to more drastic analog cosmological scenarios with improved predictability in the ultraviolet regime that ultimately may lead to the observation of a scale-invariant cosmological power spectrum in the laboratory."}

From the 143 known PNe of M~33, the photometry of only 13 are present in the J-PLUS catalog, as available on the J-PLUS portal. With the aim of recovering a larger fraction of the M~33 PN population, the software SExtractor is adopted to extract the sources in the J-PLUS images and obtain the photometric data for the PNe known in the literature, performing PSF photometry when possible. With this procedure the photometry of 98 PNe was obtained using H$α$ image as detection image, including the 13 already present in the J-PLUS catalog. Using diagnostic color-color diagrams (DCCDs) based on criteria developed for Milky Way halo PNe, we identified 16 sources with PN-like colors. Cross-match with existing catalogs revealed that most of these candidates are H II regions, though one source remains unidentified. Additionally, analyzing their full width at half maximum, most of them would not be PN candidates. This highlights the method's ability to select emission-line objects but also underscores the challenge of distinguishing PNe from contaminants using photometry alone. The J-PLUS colors of 98 known PNe were analyzed, together with literature information on their radial velocities, resulting in the identification of one possible halo PN. This is the first paper which aims at detecting extragalactic PNe in multi-band surveys such as J-PLUS, the Southern Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) and the Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS), paving the way for similar studies in these surveys for other nearby galaxies, which lack catalogs of known PNe."}

The two solvers explored in this work include one using quasi-isotropic coordinates (QIC) in Spherical coordinates while the other solves the eXtended Conformal Thin Sandwich (XCTS) decomposition in Cartesian coordinates, enabling the construction of equilibrium configurations with high accuracy and efficiency. In this work we adopt the Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu differential rotation law, however, the code is designed to be extensible to other rotation laws, allowing for exploration of physically relevant sequences and critical rotation thresholds. Furthermore, we perform convergence tests demonstrating the exponential accuracy of the spectral approach, we validate QIC and XCTS solutions against models well-studied in the literature, and we also compare FUKA solutions against the well-known RNS code. Finally, we explore the impact that initial data resolution has on dynamical simulations and recover the convergence order of the evolution scheme, the dominate source of error in this study. The new FUKA codes and results presented here lay the foundation for future extensions to more general configurations, including magnetic fields, removal of isentropic assumptions, and binary systems, and have been made publicly available to support community efforts in modeling differentially rotating relativistic stars."}

Ferreira"], "title": "Symbolically regressing dark matter halo profiles using weak lensing", "comment": "21 pages, 5 figures; submitted to MNRAS", "summary": "The structure of dark matter haloes is often described by radial density profiles motivated by cosmological simulations. These are typically assumed to have a fixed functional form (e.g. NFW), with some free parameters that can be constrained with observations. However, relying on simulations has the disadvantage that the resulting profiles depend on the dark matter model and the baryonic physics implementation, which are highly uncertain. Instead, we present a method to constrain halo density profiles directly from observations. This is done using a symbolic regression algorithm called Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR). ESR searches for the optimal analytic expression to fit data, combining both accuracy and simplicity. We apply ESR to a sample of 149 galaxy clusters from the HSC-XXL survey to identify which functional forms perform best across the entire sample of clusters. We identify density profiles that statistically outperform NFW under a minimum-description-length criterion. Within the radial range probed by the weak-lensing data ($R \\sim 0.3 - 3$ h$^{-1}$ Mpc), the highest-ranked ESR profiles exhibit shallow inner behaviour and a maximum in the density profile. As a practical application, we show how the best-fitting ESR models can be used to obtain enclosed mass estimates. We find masses that are, on average, higher than those derived using NFW, highlighting a source of potential bias when assuming the wrong density profile. These results have important knock-on effects for analyses that utilise clusters, for example cosmological constraints on $σ_8$ and $Ω_m$ from cluster abundance and clustering. Beyond the HSC dataset, the method is readily applicable to any data constraining the dark matter distribution in galaxies and galaxy clusters, such as other weak lensing surveys, galactic rotation curves, or complementary probes."}

[1] and derive a complete set of local consistency conditions for bulk fields in braneworld scenarios with an arbitrary number of dimensions. This provides the first fully local and dimension-independent generalization of all known criteria for bulk fields. Within this framework, we show that a free scalar field is consistent and localized, whereas minimally and non-minimally coupled Maxwell fields violate the conditions, leading to a no-go theorem valid in any dimension. For nonlinear electrodynamics, we find that only the model $L(F)=b\\sqrt{F}$ admits a consistent and normalizable zero mode, and that among p-forms, consistency occurs solely for the free 0-form. We also demonstrate that Dirac fermions, with or without Yukawa terms, are inconsistent within this framework and therefore cannot propagate in the bulk. Our local approach makes explicit that these conclusions do not depend on any particular internal geometry or warp factor: previously known results arise merely as special cases of a broader and strictly local structure, highlighting the universality of the constraints derived here."}

This applies in particular when the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) becomes operable in 2027, which is expected to close an important gap in our understanding of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and other areas of astrophysics. To this end, foreground objects, contaminants of the 21-cm signal, need to be identified and subtracted. Source finding and identification is thus an important albeit challenging task. We investigate the ability of AI and deep learning (DL) methods that have been previously trained on other data domains to localize and classify radio galaxies with minimal changes to their architectures. Various well-known pretrained neural network architectures for image classification and object detection are trained and fine-tuned and their performance is evaluated on a public radio galaxy dataset derived from the Radio Galaxy Zoo. A comparison between convolutional neural network (CNN)- and transformer-based algorithms is performed. The best performing architecture is systematically optimized and an uncertainty estimation is performed by means of an ensemble analysis. Radio source classification performance nearly comparable to the current leading customized models can be obtained using existing standard pretrained DL architectures, without modification and increase in complexity of the model architectures but rather adaptation of the data, by combining various transformations on replicated image channels. Using an ensemble of models can also further improve performance to over 90% accuracy, on par with top-performing models in the literature. The results can be transferred to other survey data, e.g. from the Murchison Wide-field Array (MWA), and in the future be used to study the EoR with the SKAO."}

Recently, AI models trained on EoR simulations have gained significant attention as a powerful and flexible option for inferring parameters from 21cm observations. However, previous works show that AI models trained on data from one simulator fail to generalize to data from another, raising doubts about AI models' ability to accurately infer parameters from observation. We develop a new strategy for training AI models on cosmological simulations based on the principle that increasing the diversity of the training dataset improves model robustness by averaging out spurious and contradictory information. We train AI models on data from different combinations of four simulators, then compare the models' performance when predicting on data from held-out simulators acting as proxies for the real universe. We find that models trained on data from multiple simulators perform better on data from a held-out simulator than models trained on data from a single simulator, indicating that increasing the diversity of the training dataset improves a model's ability to generalize. This result suggests that future EoR parameter inference methods can mitigate simulator-specific bias by incorporating multiple simulation approaches into their analyses."}

These problems are usually `fixed' by postulating the existence of a scalar field (called the ``inflaton''). However, other less ad hoc options are possible. In the running vacuum model (RVM) framework, the vacuum energy density (VED) is a function of the Hubble rate $H$ and its time derivatives: $ρ_{\\rm vac}=ρ_{\\rm vac}(H, \\dot{H},\\ddot{H},\\dots)$. In this context, the VED is dynamical (there is no rigid cosmological constant $Λ$). In the FLRW epoch, $ρ_{\\rm vac}$ evolves very slowly with expansion, as befits the observed $Λ\\simeq$const. behavior. In contrast, in the very early universe the vacuum fluctuations induce higher powers $H^N$ capable of unleashing fast inflation in a short period in which $H\\simeq$ const. We call this mechanism `RVM-inflation'. It does not require an inflaton field since inflation is brought about by pure quantum field theory (QFT) effects on the dynamical background. It is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant. In this work, we study a closely related scenario: the decay of the exact de Sitter vacuum into FLRW spacetime in its radiation epoch and the subsequent impact on the current universe, and compare with the RVM. We find that in both cases inflation is driven by $H^4$ powers together with subleading contributions of order $H^2$ that ease a graceful-exit transition into the radiation-dominated epoch, where the FLRW regime starts and ultimately develops a mildly evolving VED in the late universe: $δρ_{\\rm vac}\\sim {\\cal O}(m_{\\rm Pl} ^2 H^2)$. The outcome is an unified QFT approach to inflation and dark energy (conceived as dynamical vacuum energy) with potentially measurable phenomenological consequences in the present universe which can help to cure the cosmological tensions."}

This can be simply realized with a standard quintessence scalar field that controls the DM mass. In particular a background with phantom crossing can be effectively realized without introducing ghosts or other pathologies. For example one can reproduce exactly the background that gives the best fit to the recent DESI+CMB+DESY5 data, within the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization of DE. Although the background evolution is identical, the perturbations differ, leading to modified growth of structures. If the DM mass varies at late times, early-time observables are not modified and can reproduce the main predictions of the target model, but late-time observables are affected. We discuss in particular the effects on the matter power spectrum, CMB lensing and ISW effect. When reproducing the best fit CPL background model, this scenario generically predicts $\\mathcal{O}(10\\%)$ deviations in such observables. However, for suitable choices of parameters, effects on the matter power spectrum can be smaller, motivating a detailed study. In general, energy exchange between DE and DM generates a mismatch between the matter power spectrum and the gravitational potential amplitudes compared to the decoupled case, that can lead to deviations observable in future experiments."}

Restricting to the case of nonspinning binaries and first order in self-force, we compute the constants of motion and the corrections to fundamental frequencies numerically as well as analytically (to 9PN in a post-Newtonian expansion), establishing consistency with the highest-order (4PN) results available from post-Newtonian theory.

We show that dust extinction systematically overestimates scale heights at shorter rest-frame wavelengths, and therefore adopt a fixed rest-frame wavelength of 1 $μ$m. After further correcting for projection-induced bias using a new accurate method, we find that the median disk scale height increases from $0.56\\pm0.03$ kpc at $z=3.25$ to $0.84\\pm0.04$ kpc at $z=1.25$, and subsequently decreases to $0.67\\pm0.06$ kpc at $z=0.25$. The disk length-to-height ratio remains constant at $2.7\\pm0.2$ for $z>1.5$, but rises to $4.0\\pm0.4$ at $z=0.25$. These results imply that the high-redshift progenitors of present-day thick disks were of intermediate thickness, neither thin nor thick, yet dynamically hot and dense. The observed radial variation of scale height is consistent with the artificial flaring expected from observational effects, disfavoring minor mergers as the primary mechanism of disk thickening. Instead, we suggest that the high-redshift intermediate-thickness disks were single-component systems that increased their vertical scale height through decreasing surface mass density and/or violent gravitational instabilities, eventually producing thick disks. Thin-disk growth begins at $z\\approx2$ and dominates at $z\\lesssim1$, yielding a vertically more compact system with decreasing scale heights from $z\\approx1$ to $0$. The inferred thin-disk mass fraction increases from $0.1\\pm0.03$ at $z=1$ to $0.6\\pm0.1$ at $z=0$.

In particular, we highlight the occurrence of a big rip for fractional values of the Lévy's index in the allowed range $1<α\\leq2$. Moreover, we conclude that the occurrence of a pseudo-rip requires Lévy's index to be $α>2$. Therefore, we reject the possibility of pseudo-rip within the GO cutoff. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the occurrence of the little rip in FHDE equipped with a GO cutoff is rather contrived and requires a specific functional form of the IR cutoff $L\\sim(γH^{2}+g(H))^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$, which belongs to a larger class of Nojiri-Odintsov (NO) cutoffs. To extend our perspective beyond the GO cutoff, we investigate the interacting FHDE framework equipped with the Hubble cutoff, i.e., $L=H^{-1}$, in developing an ansatz-based approach to the little and pseudo-rip singularities as they fail to appear in the GO cutoff. Within this approach, we invoke the expression of the Hubble parameter, $H(t)$, which corresponds to the little and pseudo-rip, into the cosmological parameters such as the Equation of State (EoS) and Squared Sound Speed (SSS) as a function of cosmic time $t$. We produce numerical plots of these parameters in both linear and non-linear $Q$ regimes, which supplement our theoretical findings. In summary, our results highlight the occurrence of little and pseudo-rip singularities within a Hubble cutoff for a non-linear $Q$ term within the FHDE framework."}

In this work, we explore the capabilities of future space-based gravitational wave detectors, including LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, to constrain such induced GWs as well as the PBH abundance. We systematically account for the width of the primordial curvature power spectrum, and find that the asteroid-mass window can be fully probed by all three space-based interferometers.

Despite its relative proximity, the 3D structure of the CMZ remains poorly constrained, primarily due to projection effects. We aim to constrain the line-of-sight location of two molecular clouds in the CMZ -the 50 and 20 km/s clouds- and to investigate their possible physical connection using stellar kinematics and photometry. This study serves as a pilot for future applications across the full CMZ. We estimated the line-of-sight position of the clouds by analysing stellar kinematics, stellar densities, and stellar populations towards the cloud regions and a control field. We find an absence of westward moving stars in the cloud regions, which indicates that they lie on the near side of the CMZ. This interpretation is supported by the stellar density distributions. The similar behaviour observed in the two clouds, as well as in the region between them (the ridge), suggests that they are located at comparable distances and are physically linked. We also identified an intermediate-age stellar population (2-7 Gyr) in both regions, consistent with that observed on the near side of the CMZ. We estimated the line-of-sight distances at which the clouds and the ridge become kinematically detectable (i.e. where the proper motion component parallel to the Galactic plane differs from that of the control field at the 3 sigma level) by converting their measured proper motions parallel to the Galactic plane using a theoretical model of the stellar distribution.

In this study we employed the IllustrisTNG50-1 simulation to demonstrate that knowledge of the turbulence in the cosmic baryonic fluid is crucial for correctly understanding both the spatial distribution and the physical origins of the missing baryons in the Universe. First, we find that dynamical effects cause the gas to be detained in low-density and intermediate-density regions, resulting in high baryon fractions, and prevent the convergence of the gas in high-density regions, leading to low baryon fractions. Second, turbulent energy is converted into thermal energy, and the injection and dissipation of turbulent energy have essentially reached a balance from $z=1$ to $0$. This indicates that the cosmic fluid is in a steady state within this redshift range. Due to turbulent heating, as the redshift decreases, an increasing amount of warm gas is heated and converted into the WHIM, and some even into hot gas. We find that, compared with turbulence in the cosmic fluid, shocks are unimportant in intermediate-density regions and even negligible in high-density regions, both dynamically and thermodynamically. This finding accounts for the origin of the WHIM in terms of both dynamics and thermodynamics, calls into question the traditional view of shock-heating, and highlights the importance of turbulence in shaping the large-scale structure of the Universe, particularly in the evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters. In addition to TNG50-1, we validated our key findings with TNG50-2, TNG100-1, WIGEON, and EAGLE simulations, demonstrating that the spatial resolution, box size, and sub-grid-physics variations do not affect our main conclusions."}

These problems are usually `fixed' by postulating the existence of a scalar field (called the ``inflaton''). However, other less ad hoc options are possible. In the running vacuum model (RVM) framework, the vacuum energy density (VED) is a function of the Hubble rate $H$ and its time derivatives: $ρ_{\\rm vac}=ρ_{\\rm vac}(H, \\dot{H},\\ddot{H},\\dots)$. In this context, the VED is dynamical (there is no rigid cosmological constant $Λ$). In the FLRW epoch, $ρ_{\\rm vac}$ evolves very slowly with expansion, as befits the observed $Λ\\simeq$const. behavior. In contrast, in the very early universe the vacuum fluctuations induce higher powers $H^N$ capable of unleashing fast inflation in a short period in which $H\\simeq$ const. We call this mechanism `RVM-inflation'. It does not require an inflaton field since inflation is brought about by pure quantum field theory (QFT) effects on the dynamical background. It is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant. In this work, we study a closely related scenario: the decay of the exact de Sitter vacuum into FLRW spacetime in its radiation epoch and the subsequent impact on the current universe, and compare with the RVM. We find that in both cases inflation is driven by $H^4$ powers together with subleading contributions of order $H^2$ that ease a graceful-exit transition into the radiation-dominated epoch, where the FLRW regime starts and ultimately develops a mildly evolving VED in the late universe: $δρ_{\\rm vac}\\sim {\\cal O}(m_{\\rm Pl} ^2 H^2)$.

Instead, we present a method to constrain halo density profiles directly from observations. This is done using a symbolic regression algorithm called Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR). ESR searches for the optimal analytic expression to fit data, combining both accuracy and simplicity. We apply ESR to a sample of 149 galaxy clusters from the HSC-XXL survey to identify which functional forms perform best across the entire sample of clusters. We identify density profiles that statistically outperform NFW under a minimum-description-length criterion. Within the radial range probed by the weak-lensing data ($R \\sim 0.3 - 3$ h$^{-1}$ Mpc), the highest-ranked ESR profiles exhibit shallow inner behaviour and a maximum in the density profile. As a practical application, we show how the best-fitting ESR models can be used to obtain enclosed mass estimates. We find masses that are, on average, higher than those derived using NFW, highlighting a source of potential bias when assuming the wrong density profile. These results have important knock-on effects for analyses that utilise clusters, for example cosmological constraints on $σ_8$ and $Ω_m$ from cluster abundance and clustering. Beyond the HSC dataset, the method is readily applicable to any data constraining the dark matter distribution in galaxies and galaxy clusters, such as other weak lensing surveys, galactic rotation curves, or complementary probes."}
