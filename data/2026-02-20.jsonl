To further explore and ascertain insights, it is necessary to utilize galaxy simulations to track the time evolution of the observed causal relations to learn more about the temporal nature of the changing SMBH/galaxy evolutionary directions. We conducted experiments with the NIHAO suite of cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations to follow the evolution of individual galaxies along with their central SMBH masses ($M_\\unicode{x25CF}$) and properties, including central stellar velocity dispersion ($σ_0$). We reproduce the causal results from real galaxies, but add clarity by observing that the SMBH/galaxy causal directions are noticeably inverted between the epochs before and after the peak of star formation.

Comments welcome", "summary": "Modern cosmology and galaxy formation rely on an understanding of how cosmic baryons are distributed, a significant portion of which exist in the diffuse gas confined to halos. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are a promising probe of the Universe's ionized gas. At low redshift, the contribution to the dispersion measure (DM) from the intergalactic medium (IGM) and intervening halos is subdominant, allowing us to study the circumgalactic media (CGM) of the host galaxies. We select a sample of five local universe FRBs whose host interstellar medium (ISM) DM is negligible and use these to constrain the mass of the CGM in each halo. We find that one of our sources, the only massive elliptical host galaxy, has been evacuated of its baryons ($M_\\mathrm{gas}=0.02^{+0.02}_{-0.02}M_\\mathrm{h}$, corresponding to $\\sim$10$\\%$ of the cosmological average $\\frac{Ω_b}{Ω_m}$). This galaxy shows evidence of a past episode of AGN activity, consistent with the picture of strong AGN feedback in galaxy group-scale halos. The other sources are consistent with existing multiwavelength data and tentatively support more baryon retention in $L_*$ galaxies compared to group-scale halos. We show that FRBs can measure the halo gas fraction $f_\\mathrm{gas}$ in halos of mass $M_\\mathrm{h}\\sim10^{11-13}M_\\odot$, and up to $\\sim10^{14}M_\\odot$ if galaxy cluster hosts are included, which is a larger range than other gas probes can access. Finally, we demonstrate that a large sample of local universe FRBs, such as those expected from upcoming all-sky radio telescopes, will enable precision measurements of halo gas, which is crucial for understanding the effects of feedback."}

In contrast to the original Fan-Wang solution, which was obtained in four-dimensional general relativity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics, our higher-dimensional generalization does not require any matter fields. Instead, regularity is achieved purely through an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections. We demonstrate that the Fan-Wang-type metric is a solution to the QTG field equations by explicitly determining the corresponding coupling constants for each curvature order. Within an appropriate parameter regime, the solution describes an asymptotically flat black hole spacetime with a regular center. Remarkably, even in the case of negative mass, the geometry can remain completely regular, in sharp contrast to Einstein gravity."}

A natural step in extending inference pipelines to other summary statistics is to include higher order N-point correlation functions (NPCFs), which are computationally expensive and difficult to model. At the same time it is unclear how many NPCFs one would have to include to reasonably exhaust the cosmological information in the observable fields. An efficient alternative is given by learned and optimized summary statistics, largely driven by overparametrization through neural networks. This, however, largely abandons our physical intuition on the NPCF formalism and information extraction becomes opaque to the practitioner. We design a simulation-based inference pipeline, that not only benefits from the efficiency of machine learned summaries through optimization, but also holds on to the NPCF program. We employ the heavily constrained Cosmological Correlator Convolutional Neural Network (C3NN) which extracts summary statistics that can be directly linked to a given order NPCF. We present an application of our framework to simulated lensing convergence maps and study the information content of our learned summary at various orders in NPCFs for this idealized example. We view our approach as an exciting new avenue for physics-informed simulation-based inference."}

Prevailing theories suggest that AGN-driven outflows are driven either by radiation pressure acting directly on the dusty interstellar medium (ISM) or by hot winds entraining cooler ISM gas, but the relative contribution of each mechanism remains uncertain. By combining optical emission line measurements with highly ionized UV emission lines, it is possible to constrain whether the pressure source applied to ionized clouds is primarily radiation or primarily hydrodynamic, and thus constrain the dominant driver. This study presents the first multi-object analysis of far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra from galactic-scale AGN-driven outflows in obscured quasars, based on Cosmic Origins Spectrograph observations of five low-redshift targets. By comparing narrow-line region UV emission line ratios to theoretical models that vary the importance of the two pressure sources, we find three out of five targets fall within the radiation pressure-dominated regime. A fourth target exhibits intermediate emission-line ratios that suggest radiation pressure and pressure from a hot wind are both dynamically important. Finally, the lowest-luminosity object in our sample may have a dynamically important hot wind component, but non-detections prevent a clear conclusion in this case. These results suggest radiation pressure dominates circum-nuclear narrow-line region cloud dynamics, but pressure from a hot wind also plays a role in some cases. This is consistent with AGN feedback scenarios mediated by radiation pressure or a short-lived hot wind phase that dissipates after initially accelerating outflows."}

We calculate the expected GWB anisotropies using empirically calibrated models for the merger rates of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The anisotropies reflect both shot-noise in the discrete SMBHB populations while also tracing, in part, the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. The shot-noise term is sensitive to the high-mass end of the merging SMBH mass function, depends somewhat on the low-redshift tail of the merger distribution, and is a strong function of observing frequency. The precise frequency dependence provides a test of SMBHB residence times. In our models, the mean shot-noise anisotropy typically lies close to or above the broad frequency-band NANOGrav upper limits. Consequently, near-future PTA data, and potentially re-analyses of existing measurements using frequency-dependent shot-noise anisotropy templates, should be capable of detecting this signal or placing meaningful constraints on SMBHB merger models. A full interpretation, however, will require modeling the probability distribution of shot-noise amplitudes rather than relying solely on ensemble-averaged predictions. The LSS-induced anisotropies are at least two to three orders of magnitude smaller. Although the LSS contribution contains valuable information regarding the redshift distribution and clustering bias of the merging SMBHBs, detecting this component will be challenging."}

The L1157-mm outflow is the only low-mass protostellar outflow that has extensively been studied in this regard.

In addition to typical outflow tracers such as SiO and CO, outflow emission is seen from H2CO, HNCO, and HC3N, as well as from the COMs CH3OH, CH3CN, and CH3CHO, and even from deuterated species such as DCN, D2CO, and CH2DOH. Maps of integrated intensity ratios between CH3OH and DCN, D2CO, and CH3CHO reveal gradients with distance from the protostar. Intensity ratio maps of HC3N and CH3CN with respect to CH3OH peak in the southern lobe where temperatures are highest. Rotational temperatures derived towards two positions, one in each lobe, are found in the range ~50-100 K. Abundances with respect to CH3OH are higher by factors of a few than for the L1157-B1. In conclusion, for the first time, we securely detected the COMs CH3CN, CH3CHO, and CH2DOH in the IRAS 4B1 outflow, serendipitously with limited sensitivity and bandwidth. Targeted observations will enable the discovery of new COMs and a more detailed analysis of their emission. Morphological differences between molecules in the IRAS 4B1 outflow lobes and their relative abundances provide first proof that this outflow is a promising new laboratory for shock chemistry, which will offer crucial information on COM formation and destruction as well as outflow structure and kinematics."}

A key component of this is dynamical modelling methods which have allowed for crucial insights to be made from kinematic data. Despite this importance, most dynamical models make a number of key assumptions which do not hold for real galaxies. These include assumptions about the geometry (axisymmetry or triaxiality), the shape of the velocity ellipsoid, and the shape of the underlying stellar distribution. At the same time, machine learning methods are becoming increasingly powerful, with many applications appearing in astronomy. As a first step towards building new dynamical modelling methods with machine learning, it is important to understand the types of machine learning architectures that are best fit for dynamical modelling. To investigate this, we construct a training set of dynamical models of early-type galaxies using Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM). We then train a neural network on this data using the parameters of JAM and mock photometry as the input. We are able to accurately model JAM galaxies with relatively simple machine learning architectures, leading to a significant speed increase over traditional JAM modelling."}

A ``law'' in theoretical physics is said to be observable or empirical only if it can be verified/falsified by some experimental procedure. The notion of empiricality/observability becomes far more unclear in QFTCS, than in QFT in Minkowski (flat) spacetime (QFTM), mainly because QFTCS lacks the notion of vacuum. This could potentially undermine the status of QFTCS as a physical (not only mathematical) theory. We consider this problem for the Majorana field in curved spacetime, and examine some examples of the empirical laws."}

We want measure $β$ for galaxies at $z>7.5$ using the strong lensing around massive galaxy clusters to observe high-redshift and faint galaxies. The low-brightness regime is of particular interest for reionization, as most of the recent models of this process posit that numerous faint galaxies are the prime drivers of reionization.

For 14 galaxies we estimate an average $f_{esc}=0.26\\pm0.22$. The flat trend of $β$ at $z>7.5$ suggests similar properties between $300$ and $600 Myr$ after the Big Bang. The weak trend between $β$ and $M_{UV}$ suggests an analogous composition for low- and high-mass galaxies' ISM, likely due to a lack of time for dust buildup.

The presence of a local maximum allows for unstable circular orbits to exist similar to light rings present in actual BH solutions, while it has been conjectured that the presence of a local minimum is symptomatic of potential instabilities. One such candidate for a BHM is a solitonic boson star (SBS) which is a boson star endowed with a sextic potential. In this paper we investigate further solutions of static and spherically symmetric SBSs in general relativity with a larger set of parameter values, and argue that such solutions are very similar to UCOs composed of an incompressible perfect fluid (IPF) with a sufficiently large pressure (the mimicker of a BHM). These IPFUCOs reach the Buchdahl limit $C= 4/9$ for arbitrarily large pressures. We investigate the extent to which the IPFUCOs constructed within a quadratic model in $f(R)$ gravity can overcome this limit or not, and thus pave the way for possibly building SBSs (or other kind of UCO) within this (or other alternative theory of gravity). We further elaborate about the stability properties of SBSs which have been the subject of some controversy recently."}

This yields a compact non-linear evolution equation for the Eulerian density contrast, controlled by a time- and density-dependent effective gravitational strength, and provides a direct map between model functions and void observables. We apply the framework to the luminal Galileon class of models, where derivative self-interactions generate Vainshtein screening and might lead to a breakdown of the physical branch in sufficiently underdense regions. Exploiting this feature, we apply the void-informed viability requirement that translates into bounds on the theory parameter space and, equivalently, on the minimum attainable void depth as a function of redshift. For viable parameters of a concrete model, we quantify the impact of MG on isolated void evolution, the Lagrangian to Eulerian mapping, and the shell-crossing threshold. Relative to GR, we find a clear hierarchy of MG effects, with ${\\cal O}(10\\%)$ modifications in the gravitational couplings, percent-level shifts in the void density evolution, and sub-percent deviations in both the mapping and the shell-crossing thresholds. Moreover, within the adopted parametrization, we show analytically that voids always lie in an unscreened regime on the physical branch.

We aim to explore the recently detected, thioethanal (CH$_{3}$CHS) formation mechanisms from thioethanol (CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH) as a precursor in addition to secondary sulfur products. The electronic structure methods and density functional theory for both gas-phase and ice-grain surface environments is employed. To mimic interstellar ice-mantles, we use medium (W6) and large amorphized (W22) water clusters as implemented in Binding Energy Evaluation protocol. A barrierless formation mechanism for CH$_{3}$CHS under low-temperature interstellar conditions is identified, in the gas phase. Surface environments modulate activation barriers in a site-specific manner, elucidated through both Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal initiated surface reaction pathways. Compared to oxygen analogs, sulfur chemistry enables alternate pathways due to weaker S-H bonding, with a competing route forming ethane-1,1-di-thiol (CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH), on the ice-grain surface, potentially reducing CH$_{3}$CHS yields. The first accurate binding energy for thioethanol on water ice is also reported, confirming its greater volatility than ethanol. The proposed mechanism offers a tentative hypothesis for the apparent mutual exclusive detections of the CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH and CH$_{3}$CHS in TMC-1, Orion, and Sgr B2(N), that further requires validation through quantitative astrochemical modeling and also to distinguish this chemical differentiation from observational sensitivity limitations. These qualitative findings highlight the multifaceted chemical behavior of sulfur-bearing organics in the interstellar medium and support CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH as promising astro-chemical targets."}

This parameter regularizes the geometry by removing the central singularity. Focusing on wave dynamics, we analyze scalar perturbations, quasinormal modes, and greybody factors, emphasizing the role of the regularization parameter on the effective potential and the decay properties of the modes. Using WKB methods beyond the eikonal limit, we show that the presence of scalar hair modifies both the oscillation frequencies and damping rates of quasinormal modes. In particular, we demonstrate the occurrence of an anomalous decay rate for massive scalar perturbations: above a critical field mass, the longest-lived modes correspond to lower angular momentum, in contrast with the massless case. We derive analytical expressions for the critical mass and study its dependence on the scalar charge and overtone number. Furthermore, we apply the Horowitz-Hubeny method to compute the quasinormal frequencies and show that the results obtained from the WKB and Horowitz-Hubeny approaches exhibit excellent agreement in the regime where both methods are valid. In addition, we compute reflection and transmission coefficients and analyze the corresponding greybody factors, clarifying how regularity effects imprint themselves on black-hole scattering properties. Our results show that regular black holes with scalar hair exhibit distinctive dynamical signatures that can be probed through quasinormal ringing and wave propagation."}

The H I covering fraction (k_HI) within the virial radius (Rvir) of low-mass (7 < log10(M*/Msun)< 9) galaxies, for a threshold column density of log10(N(HI)/cm^-2) = 14.5, exhibits an enhancement along both the disk plane (azimuthal angle phi < 20 degree) and in the polar direction (phi > 70 degree). In contrast, such a bimodal distribution is not observed for higher mass galaxies (9 < log10(M*/Msun) < 11.3). Similarly, the O VI covering fraction (k_OVI), for a threshold of log10(N(OVI)/cm^-2) = 14.0, shows a tentative enhancement along both the projected major and minor axes for low-mass galaxies. In contrast, O VI-bearing gas around higher- mass galaxies appears more uniformly distributed, with no significant azimuthal dependence. Finally, using the halo circular-velocity-normalized pixel-velocity two-point correlation function (TPCF), we find that O VI absorbers are kinematically narrower along the disk plane compared to the polar directions of the host galaxies with similar stellar mass distributions. The observed isotropic distribution of O VI in high-mass halos suggests that its spatial distribution is governed by global halo properties; however, the O VI kinematics retain memory of the site of origin."}

While models of this process have advanced, they typically focus on asymptotically flat spacetimes. In this paper, we explore how the absence of asymptotic flatness affects the slow, adiabatic orbital evolution due to radiation reaction. This lack of asymptotic flatness can arise from external environments or an expanding universe. Using the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, where the deviation from flatness is governed by the cosmological constant, we study bound orbits characterized by their semi-latus rectum $p$ and eccentricity $e$. We calculate how the cosmological constant shifts the separatrix between bound and plunging orbits and alters the relationship between the binary's binding energy, angular momentum, and orbital parameters. Assuming the orbital timescale is much shorter than the inspiral timescale, we apply a modified quadrupole formula to examine the impact of a small positive cosmological constant on the orbital evolution in the weak-field limit. We find that the cosmological constant accelerates the decrease in eccentricity, reducing inspiral plunge times, which could influence event rate estimates for space-based detectors."}

Very little is known about the nature and origins of this population of \"Ultra-Faint Compact Satellites\" (UFCSs) owing to a dearth of spectroscopic measurements. Here, we present the first spectroscopic census of these compact systems based on Magellan/IMACS and Keck/DEIMOS observations of 19 individual UFCSs, representing $\\sim$2/3 of the known population. We securely measure mean radial velocities for all 19 systems, velocity dispersions for 15 (predominantly upper limits), metallicities for 17, metallicity dispersions for 8, and $\\textit{Gaia}$-based mean proper motions for 18. This large new spectroscopic sample provides the first insights into population-level trends for these extreme satellites. We demonstrate that: (1) the UFCSs are kinematically colder, on average, than the UFDs, disfavoring very dense dark matter halos in most cases, (2) the UFCS population is chemically diverse, spanning a factor of $\\sim$300 in mean iron abundance ($\\rm -3.3 \\lesssim [Fe/H] \\lesssim -0.8$), with multiple systems falling beneath the \"metallicity floor\" proposed for GCs, and (3) while some higher-metallicity and/or younger UFCSs are clearly star clusters, the dynamical and/or chemical evidence allows the possibility that up to $\\sim$50% of the UFCSs in our sample (9 of 19) may represent the smallest and least-massive galaxies yet discovered."}

This causes the spins to precess and leads to an asymmetric emission of gravitational waves. The resulting gravitational-wave multipole asymmetries directly source the recoil of the remnant black hole and are the critical element in fully describing precession. Recoil and precession are of significant astrophysical importance, but multipole asymmetries contribute only minimally to the overall signal strength. Consequently, most current gravitational-wave models either do not incorporate asymmetries at all, or only consider the dominant ones. Here we highlight the importance of subdominant multipole asymmetries for an accurate recoil velocity calculation and discuss their detectability with third generation detectors. Neglecting subdominant asymmetries leads to velocity differences of up to 210 km/s and can, in particular, introduce systematic biases in the inference of masses and the spin geometry. We further discuss universal characteristics of subdominant multipole asymmetries in order to prepare the ground for potential future asymmetry models. In the inspiral regime, the average antisymmetric frequencies can be described by a multiple of the orbital frequency. During ringdown, however, they become equal to their corresponding symmetric frequencies."}

We calculate the expected GWB anisotropies using empirically calibrated models for the merger rates of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The anisotropies reflect both shot-noise in the discrete SMBHB populations while also tracing, in part, the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. The shot-noise term is sensitive to the high-mass end of the merging SMBH mass function, depends somewhat on the low-redshift tail of the merger distribution, and is a strong function of observing frequency. The precise frequency dependence provides a test of SMBHB residence times. In our models, the mean shot-noise anisotropy typically lies close to or above the broad frequency-band NANOGrav upper limits. Consequently, near-future PTA data, and potentially re-analyses of existing measurements using frequency-dependent shot-noise anisotropy templates, should be capable of detecting this signal or placing meaningful constraints on SMBHB merger models. A full interpretation, however, will require modeling the probability distribution of shot-noise amplitudes rather than relying solely on ensemble-averaged predictions. The LSS-induced anisotropies are at least two to three orders of magnitude smaller. Although the LSS contribution contains valuable information regarding the redshift distribution and clustering bias of the merging SMBHBs, detecting this component will be challenging."}

This potential generalizes standard exponential inflation and naturally arises in braneworld scenarios.

In the minimally coupled case, the model predicts $n_s \\simeq 0.976$ and $r \\simeq 0.035$ for $N=50$ and moderate values of β, remaining compatible with ACT+DESI constraints at the 1σlevel while yielding a spectral tilt larger than the universal attractor prediction.

Newton Singh", "B. Mishra"], "title": "Possible existence of super Chandrasekhar mass limit in the matter-curvature coupled gravity", "comment": "23 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables", "summary": "We investigate white dwarfs in the framework of f(R,L_m) and f(R,L_m,T) gravity to explore the Chandrasekhar Limit. We have considered two functional forms of f(R,L_m) and one functional form of f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Considering the matter Lagrangian L_m=p, we calculate modified TOV equations for each of the forms. By employing the fully degenerate electron gas equation of state in the modified TOV equations, we derive the mass-radius relation for each functional form of both f(R,L_m) and f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Our models imply modifications in the Chandrasekhar mass limit that deviate significantly from the GR and the Newtonian cases. In the f(R,L_m, T)$ gravity, the new mass limit of the white dwarf can reach upto 1.537\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot while in f(R,L_m) with the quadratic extension can goes upto 1.52\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot and with exponential extension upto 2.08\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot. Further, we analyze the static stability criterion, the gravitational redshift, and the adiabatic indices. For the power-law form of f(R,L_m) and the non-linear form of f(R,L_m,T) gravity, significant variations are observed at higher densities (ρ_c > 10^{10}\\, \\mathrm{g/cm^3}), while substantial changes are noted at much lower central densities in the case of exponential form of f(R,L_m) gravity. We also calculate compactness and gravitational redshift, which are much lower than those of neutron stars and black holes. Stability is also confirmed by adiabatic indices, which show that all models yield Γ> 4/3 throughout the interiors of WDs. Overall, our models provide a viable framework for the existence of super-Chandrasekhar mass limit, extending beyond the classical predictions in the Newtonian and/or GR cases."}

Seymour", "Jacob Golomb", "Yanbei Chen"], "title": "Inspiral tests of general relativity and waveform geometry", "comment": "17 pages, 11 figures, comments welcome", "summary": "The phase evolution of gravitational waves encodes critical information about the orbital dynamics of binary systems. In this work, we test the robustness of parameterized tests against unmodeled deviations from general relativity. We demonstrate that these parameterized tests are flexible and sensitive in detecting generic deviations in the waveform using the Cutler-Vallisneri bias formalism. This universality arises from examining the inherent geometry of the waveform signal and understanding how biases manifest. We show how Bayes factors are governed by the intrinsic geometry of the waveform signal manifold when parameterized tests are used to approximate generic violations of GR. We use the singular value decomposition to propose templates that are orthogonal to parameterized tests, identifying degeneracies and enhancing the detection of potential deviations. More broadly, the geometric framework developed here clarifies -- at a fundamental level -- how subtle waveform effects (including orbital eccentricity, spin precession, waveform systematics, and instrumental glitches) can mimic one another in data, and when they are intrinsically distinguishable."}

Starting from accelerating Bertotti--Robinson black holes, we employ two independent mechanisms: a Melvin--Bonnor-type magnetization and an Inversion symmetry of the Einstein--Maxwell system. In both cases the external electromagnetic field can be removed, while a non-trivial gravitational backreaction remains in the metric, yielding new accelerating vacuum spacetimes of Petrov type I. In the static, non-accelerating limit, the magnetized Schwarzschild case reproduces previously known results, whereas the Inversion symmetry leads to a genuinely new vacuum configuration. These findings provide a method for generating algebraically general vacuum geometries and illustrate how electromagnetic embeddings can produce non-trivial vacuum metrics in General Relativity. The main geometrical properties of these spacetimes are discussed. Two additional results are presented in the appendices: a stationary generalization of these vacuum geometries, and two further static vacuum configurations obtained through the same symmetries but using the Alekseev--García black hole as the seed."}

We calculate the expected GWB anisotropies using empirically calibrated models for the merger rates of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The anisotropies reflect both shot-noise in the discrete SMBHB populations while also tracing, in part, the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. The shot-noise term is sensitive to the high-mass end of the merging SMBH mass function, depends somewhat on the low-redshift tail of the merger distribution, and is a strong function of observing frequency. The precise frequency dependence provides a test of SMBHB residence times. In our models, the mean shot-noise anisotropy typically lies close to or above the broad frequency-band NANOGrav upper limits. Consequently, near-future PTA data, and potentially re-analyses of existing measurements using frequency-dependent shot-noise anisotropy templates, should be capable of detecting this signal or placing meaningful constraints on SMBHB merger models. A full interpretation, however, will require modeling the probability distribution of shot-noise amplitudes rather than relying solely on ensemble-averaged predictions. The LSS-induced anisotropies are at least two to three orders of magnitude smaller. Although the LSS contribution contains valuable information regarding the redshift distribution and clustering bias of the merging SMBHBs, detecting this component will be challenging."}

This yields a compact non-linear evolution equation for the Eulerian density contrast, controlled by a time- and density-dependent effective gravitational strength, and provides a direct map between model functions and void observables. We apply the framework to the luminal Galileon class of models, where derivative self-interactions generate Vainshtein screening and might lead to a breakdown of the physical branch in sufficiently underdense regions. Exploiting this feature, we apply the void-informed viability requirement that translates into bounds on the theory parameter space and, equivalently, on the minimum attainable void depth as a function of redshift. For viable parameters of a concrete model, we quantify the impact of MG on isolated void evolution, the Lagrangian to Eulerian mapping, and the shell-crossing threshold. Relative to GR, we find a clear hierarchy of MG effects, with ${\\cal O}(10\\%)$ modifications in the gravitational couplings, percent-level shifts in the void density evolution, and sub-percent deviations in both the mapping and the shell-crossing thresholds. Moreover, within the adopted parametrization, we show analytically that voids always lie in an unscreened regime on the physical branch. Overall, the formalism provides a self-consistent route to predict void dynamics and consistency constraints in a broad class of MG models."}
