### [1] [Black Hole Feedback, Galaxy Quenching and Outflows at Cosmic Dawn: Analysis of the SEEDZ Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09104)

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: This paper analyzes massive black hole (MBH) growth and feedback in the SEEDZ simulations, finding that early super-Eddington accretion is self-limited by MBH feedback—evacuating halo gas—even with a weak feedback model; results suggest either weaker early-universe MBH feedback than assumed or a two-step galaxy formation scenario, and imply an effective upper mass limit of ~10⁶ M⊙ for MBHs before z=12.5.

Motivation: To understand how massive black holes grow and regulate their host galaxies in the early Universe, especially in light of high-redshift JWST observations.

Method: Analysis of the SEEDZ cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, focusing on MBH growth, super-Eddington accretion episodes, and feedback effects—including gas ejection and halo binding energy comparisons.

Result: MBH feedback—not supernovae or gas exhaustion—terminates early super-Eddington growth; it evacuates host halo gas into the IGM even with weak feedback; injected feedback energy exceeds halo binding energy; maximum MBH mass before z=12.5 is capped near 10⁶ M⊙, set by feedback strength and halo potential.

Conclusion: Early MBH feedback is potent enough to quench host galaxies rapidly; this challenges simple accretion models and implies either revised feedback efficiency or a two-phase galaxy formation history involving later gas re-accretion; MBH masses at z > 12.5 are strongly constrained to ≲10⁶ M⊙ unless feedback is highly localized or merger-dominated.

Abstract: Here we analyse the growth and feedback effects of massive black holes (MBHs) in the SEEDZ simulations. The most massive black holes grow to masses of $\sim10^{6}$ M$_\odot$ by $z=12.5$ during short bursts of super-Eddington accretion, sustained over a period of 5-30 Myr. We find that the determining factor that cuts off this initial growth is feedback from the MBH itself, rather than nearby supernovae or exhausting the available gas reservoir. Our simulations show that for the most actively accreting MBHs, feedback completely evacuates the gas from the host halo and ejects it into the inter-galactic medium. Despite implementing a relatively weak feedback model, the energy injected into the gas surrounding the MBH exceeds the binding energy of the halo. These results either indicate that MBH feedback in the early ($Λ$CDM) Universe is much weaker than previously assumed, or that at least some of the high redshift galaxies we currently observe with JWST formed via a two-step process, whereby a MBH initially quenches its host galaxy and later reconstitutes its baryonic reservoir, either through mergers with gas rich galaxies or from accretion from the cosmic web. Moreover, the maximum black hole masses that emerge in SEEDZ are effectively set by a combination of MBH feedback modelling and the binding potential of the host halo. Unless feedback is extremely ineffective at early times (for example if growth is merger dominated rather than accretion dominated or feedback is contained close to the MBH) then the maximum mass of black holes at redshift before 12.5 should not significantly exceed $10^6$ M$_\odot$.

### [2] [Unraveling the mysteries of Jets in peculiar NLSy1 galaxies through multi-wavelength variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09171)
*Vineet Ojha,Xue-Bing Wu,Luis C. Ho,Raj Prince,Joysankar Majumdar,Hum Chand,Chi-Zhuo Wang*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: 本研究通过多波段观测和宽带能谱建模，发现部分射电宁静窄线赛弗特1型星系（RQ-NLSy1s）存在光学与中红外变异性及延迟现象，表明其辐射中可能存在弱或间歇性喷流的非热贡献，挑战了传统上仅由吸积盘热辐射主导的认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认为RQ-NLSy1s主要由吸积盘热辐射主导，但37 GHz射电耀斑的发现提示可能存在非热过程；需系统探究其多波段变异性以厘清辐射机制。

Method: 结合ZTF光学（g/r/i波段）高采样光变曲线与WISE中红外（W1/W2波段）长期光变数据，采用FAGN检验、峰峰值振幅、分数变幅等量化光学变率，使用红移校正的内禀变幅表征MIR变率，并开展宽带SED建模。

Result: 所有源均呈现显著长时标光学变率且蓝端更强；3个源显示‘亮时更蓝’趋势；3/4源探测到内禀MIR变率；观测到显著的光学-MIR及MIR波段内延迟，而光学波段内延迟不显著；光学变幅与Eddington比呈负相关、与黑洞质量呈正相关。

Conclusion: 部分RQ-NLSy1s中存在弱或间歇性喷流，对光学和中红外辐射有可观测的非热贡献，支持其并非纯粹热辐射主导；需多波段协同监测进一步验证。

Abstract: Radio-quiet narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (RQ-NLSy1s) are generally considered to be dominated by thermal emission from the accretion disk. However, recurring 37 GHz radio flares detected from seven RQ-NLSy1s by the Metsahovi Radio Observatory suggest that non-thermal processes may also contribute to their emission. We present a systematic optical and mid-infrared (MIR) variability study combined with broadband SED modeling to investigate the origin of their flux variations and assess the relative contributions of accretion disk and possible jet-related components. High-cadence optical light curves in the g, r, and i bands were obtained from ZTF, while long-term MIR light curves in the W1 and W2 bands were taken from WISE. Optical variability was quantified using the FAGN-test, peak-to-peak variability amplitude, and fractional variability, while MIR variability was characterized using redshift-corrected intrinsic variability amplitudes. Optical variability was examined from intra-night to long-term timescales, and MIR variability on long-term timescales. All RQ-NLSy1s show statistically significant long-term optical variability, with amplitudes increasing toward shorter wavelengths. Three sources exhibit bluer-when-brighter trends and increasing variability amplitudes across the optical bands, indicating a non-thermal contribution. Intrinsic MIR variability is detected in three of the four sources. Significant optical-MIR and MIR intra-band lags are observed, while optical intra-band lags are insignificant. Optical variability amplitudes are anti-correlated with the Eddington ratio and positively correlated with black hole mass. These results suggest that a subset of RQ-NLSy1s hosts weak or intermittent jets contributing to their optical and MIR emission, supported by SED modeling. Coordinated multi-wavelength monitoring is required to better constrain the origin of these variations.

### [3] [Are carbon deflagration supernovae triggered by dark matter ?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09274)
*Jeremy Mould*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: 本文探讨了银河系核球中恒星残骸与暗物质（特别是原初黑洞）碰撞可能触发Ia型超新星的机制，并指出当前观测尚无法确认其径向分布是否更集中于星系中心，但未来Rubin望远镜的大样本数据有望解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释Ia型超新星在星系中的空间分布是否受恒星残骸与暗物质（如原初黑洞）碰撞触发的影响，从而检验该物理机制的可行性。

Method: 基于物理建模分析原初黑洞撞击白矮星时动能热化对简并核温度的影响，并考虑比热容低估和引力聚焦加速效应；结合现有Ia型超新星径向分布观测数据与未来Rubin望远镜预期数据进行对比推断。

Result: 月球质量级原初黑洞撞击白矮星足以使其核心升温至少1K（实际升温更高）；当前观测对Ia型超新星是否更集中于星系中心尚无定论；未来百万量级超新星样本将提供关键检验。

Conclusion: 碰撞触发机制在物理上可行，但需依赖下一代巡天观测验证其在真实宇宙中的重要性。

Abstract: Collisions between stellar remnants and dark matter in the Galactic bulge are frequent, and the kinetic energy of a primordial black hole incident on a white dwarf, if it is all thermalized, will raise the degenerate core's temperature, by at least a degree in the case of a lunar mass black hole. This is an underestimate in two ways: the specific heat is less than 3k/2 per particle, and the incoming object is accelerated by gravitational focusing. Detailed physical models have recently been made of this triggering event. Present observational data are equivocal as to whether the radial distribution of type Ia supernovae in galaxies follows the starlight in the galaxies, or is more concentrated towards the center, as collisional triggering would suggest. But future samples of millions of supernovae from the Rubin telescope will change that.

### [4] [Selecting Post-Starburst Galaxies Based on Star Formation History](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09308)
*Sara Starecheski,K. Decker French,Vicente Villanueva,Sebastion F. Sanchez,Tony Wong,Margaret E. Verrico,Alex Green,Akshat Tripathi,Keaton Donaghue*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于空间分辨恒星形成历史（SFH）的新方法来识别后星暴（PSB）星系及其中的PSB区域，利用MaNGA、CALIFA和AMUSING++等IFS巡天数据与Pipe3D分析流程，克服了传统光谱特征截断法对AGN的偏差，发现PSB相位中强AGN活动罕见，并揭示了多样化的PSB空间分布形态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解后星暴（PSB）星系的总体性质有助于揭示星系如何演化至宁静态；传统PSB选择方法存在对AGN的系统性偏差，且无法反映真实的恒星形成历史，亟需更直接、无偏的识别方法。

Method: 基于IFS巡天（MaNGA、CALIFA、AMUSING++）数据，使用Pipe3D流程反演空间分辨的恒星形成历史（SFH），据此直接定义并选取PSB星系和PSB空间像素（spaxel），而非依赖传统光谱指标（如Dn4000、HδA）的固定阈值。

Result: 共选出107个PSB星系，其中仅7个被以往方法识别；未发现显著的Seyfert 2型PSB星系，表明PSB相位中强AGN活动罕见；识别出多种PSB空间构型：中心聚集型、环状分布型（具内-外年龄梯度）、以及广泛分布但伴其余区域持续恒星形成的混合型。

Conclusion: 基于SFH的PSB选择方法更物理、无AGN偏差，能揭示更真实的PSB多样性；PSB并非单一演化路径，其空间分布与星系结构密切相关，挑战了部分既有认知（如年龄梯度方向）。

Abstract: Post-StarBurst (PSB) galaxies are galaxies that have undergone a large burst of star formation followed by rapid quenching. Understanding their properties as a population can help us better understand how galaxies evolve to quiescence. This project aims to use Star Formation History (SFH) measurements from the Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) surveys MaNGA, CALIFA, and AMUSING++ processed with the Pipe3D analysis pipeline in order to select PSB galaxies as well as PSB regions in galaxies. Most PSB selection methods use cutoffs determined by spectral features, but in this work we introduce a new PSB selection method based directly on the property we are most interested in; inferred SFHs. IFS data allows us to probe a galaxy's star formation on a spatially resolved scale, enabling us to examine the size, shape, and location of PSB regions within a galaxy. We select 107 PSB galaxies, only 7 of which are among known PSBs selected by other methods. Unlike traditional PSB selection methods, our approach is not biased against Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Despite this, we still find no evidence for a significant Seyfert 2 PSB population, suggesting that strong AGN activity is uncommon throughout the PSB phase. Our spatially-resolved SFH selection identifies a wide range of galaxies, including globally quiescent elliptical galaxies with centrally-concentrated PSB spaxels, galaxies with ring-like PSB spaxels and a preference for inside-out age gradients (contrary to what has previously been observed in the literature), and galaxies with widespread PSB regions that have significant star formation elsewhere in the galaxy.

### [5] [A Monopolar Jet from Protostar HOPS 10: Evidence for Asymmetric Magnetized Launching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09404)
*Somnath Dutta*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: 本文通过ALMA高分辨率观测，首次清晰揭示了原恒星HOPS 10存在一个真正单极的、高度准直的喷流，挑战了传统双极喷流模型，并提出盘磁力线上的不对称物质加载是其成因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解原恒星如何从周围盘吸积质量并移除多余角动量是恒星形成中的基本问题；尽管喷流被广泛认为是角动量移除的主要通道，但其启动与角动量提取机制仍缺乏约束。

Method: 利用ALMA Band 7（345 GHz）和Band 6（230 GHz）对HOPS 10进行高空间与速度分辨率观测，分析CO（3-2）、CO（2-1）和SiO（5-4）谱线发射，区分外流与准直喷流，并结合几何与消光分析检验单极性真实性。

Result: 发现HOPS 10存在迄今最清晰的单极原恒星喷流：仅在正向速度（+44至+66 km/s）一侧出现高视向速度喷流，而低速外流（-20至+30 km/s）呈双极；该单极性在所有谱线中一致，且SiO激波示踪确认其为真实喷流而非云污染或遮挡所致。

Conclusion: 观测排除了观测效应（如遮挡）导致单极性的可能，支持喷流本身具有内在不对称性；最合理的物理解释是沿盘磁力线的物质加载存在本质不对称，从而导致单极喷流形成。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in star formation is understanding how a protostar accretes mass from its circumstellar disk while removing excess angular momentum. Protostellar jets are widely invoked as the primary channels for angular momentum removal, yet the mechanism by which they are launched and extract angular momentum remains poorly constrained. Here we report high-resolution ALMA Band 7 (345 GHz) and Band 6 (230 GHz) observations of CO (3-2), CO (2-1), and SiO (5-4) emission from the protostar HOPS 10 (G209.55-19.68S2). The combined data trace both the entrained outflow and the collimated jet with excellent spatial and velocity resolution, revealing a uniquely monopolar protostellar jet, the clearest example reported to date. The system exhibits a distinctly unipolar high-velocity jet with velocity offsets of +44 to +66 km s-1, unlike the predominantly bipolar morphology characteristic of most protostellar jets. While the low-velocity outflow, with velocity offsets of -20 to +30 km s-1, is detected in both directions, the high-velocity jet appears only on one side, and this monopolarity is consistent across all tracers. Given the nearly edge-on geometry and low submillimeter extinction, comparable emission would normally be expected from both lobes. The shock tracer SiO emission confirms a genuine, highly collimated jet rather than cloud contamination, and no ambient structure is capable of obscuring a counterjet. We argue that intrinsically asymmetric mass loading along the disk magnetic field lines provides the most plausible explanation for the observed monopolarity.

### [6] [A deep MeerKAT view of associated HI absorption in radio AGNs at intermediate redshift: Role of absorber geometry and conditions of the gas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09478)
*Raffaella Morganti,Tom Oosterloo,Clive Tadhunter,Suma Murthy*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: 本文利用MeerKAT望远镜对17个中等红移（0.25<z<0.7）的强射电源开展中性氢（HI）吸收观测，探测到3例HI吸收，其中2例为伴生吸收（占比13%±7%），均出现在年轻射电喷流源中且紫外光度低于电离阈值；第3例为本地前景星系引起的干涉吸收。结果表明HI吸收率受源演化阶段、气体物理条件与几何结构共同影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究中等红移强射电源中性氢（HI）吸收的存在性及其与AGN和宿主星系性质（如射电/光学特征、紫外辐射强度、演化阶段）的关联，以理解气体在活动星系核环境中的分布、电离状态与动力学行为。

Method: 利用MeerKAT望远镜对17个L₁.₄GHz > 10²⁷ W Hz⁻¹、0.25 < z < 0.7的强射电源进行HI 21 cm吸收谱观测；样本涵盖核主导源与类星体；结合已有射电与光学数据，分析HI吸收是否与UV光度（L_UV = 10²³ W Hz⁻¹电离阈值）、源年龄（如喷流尺度）及几何结构相关。

Result: 获得15条低射频干扰谱线，达到极低峰值光学深度（τ_peak < 0.005）；共探测到3例HI吸收：2例为伴生吸收（PKS 1151-34 和 PKS 1306-09），均属年轻射电源且L_UV < 10²³ W Hz⁻¹；其中PKS 1151-34为类星体，暗示喷流仍嵌于环核盘内；PKS 1306-09的HI显著蓝移，可能源于喷流驱动外流；第3例（PKS 0405-12附近）为前景星系导致的‘本地干涉’吸收，距类星体约100 kpc（投影）。

Conclusion: 中等红移下HI伴生吸收检出率为13%±7%，与低红移趋势一致；检测率主要取决于射电源演化阶段（年轻源更易探测）、气体所受紫外辐射强度（低于电离阈值更利于中性氢存留）以及气体几何构型（如盘面朝向、喷流与气体相对位置）；HI吸收现象多样，反映AGN环境中多相气体复杂物理状态。

Abstract: We present MeerKAT observations searching for HI absorption in a sample of 17 powerful ($L_{\rm 1.4GHz}> 10^{27}$ W Hz$^{-1}$) radio sources at intermediate redshifts ($0.25<z<0.7$). The sample is well characterised at radio and optical wavelengths, allowing us to connect the presence (or absence) of HI to the properties of the AGN and its host galaxy. The sample consists mostly of core-dominated sources and quasars. Half of the targets have a UV luminosity $L_{\rm UV} = 10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, above this limit, the gas would be expected to be ionised by this radiation. We obtained 15 spectra free (or almost free) of radio frequency interference, reaching extremely low optical depths ($τ_{\rm peak} < 0.005$) resulting in three new HI absorption detections. Two are associated HI absorptions, giving a detection rate of such systems of $13\%\pm 7\%$. Both are found in young radio sources (PKS 1151-34 and PKS 1306-09), confirming the trend that this type of sources are more often detected in HI compared to more evolved ones. The UV luminosity of both these sources is below $10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. Surprisingly, one of the detections (PKS 1151-34) is hosted by a quasar, suggesting that the radio lobes are still embedded in the circumnuclear disc. In the second source (PKS 1306-09), the HI is highly blueshifted and likely part of a jet-driven outflow. A third detection is a 'local intervening' system, caused by a galaxy in the local environment of PKS 0405-12 and located in front of the southern radio lobe of this source, about 100 kpc in projection from this quasar. Overall, the results indicate a variety of plausible situations, which resemble what is seen at low redshifts. For the associated absorption, a combination of evolutionary status of the radio sources, physical conditions, and geometry of the gas structure determine the detection rate of HI absorption.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: 本文利用赫歇尔空间天文台的HIFI仪器对热分子核G10.47+0.03进行了远红外谱线分析，探测到多种分子，并通过MCMC方法推断出两种激发温度组分（30–65 K和90–250 K），揭示其复杂动力学环境，包括外流与激波区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定G10.47+0.03在地面望远镜无法覆盖的宽光谱范围内的分子丰度和激发条件。

Method: 使用赫歇尔空间天文台HIFI的归档数据，结合马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛（MCMC）框架反演柱密度和激发温度，并辅以能谱分布（SED）拟合约束整体物理参数。

Result: 探测到CO、13CO、C18O、H2O同位素、HCO+、HCN、HNC、CS、C34S、SO、SO2、H2CS、CH3OH等多条高激发谱线；发现CO、p-H2O、CS、HCN具有相似的蓝移窄成分，可能对应外流层；识别出两个激发温度组分：温组分（30–65 K）对应包层，热组分（90–250 K）对应致密高温核心；H2O、高激发CO和HCN谱线指示外流及高密度激波区。

Conclusion: G10.47+0.03具有复杂的动力学结构，包含内/外流、激波加热及致密热核与外围温包层共存的多相介质特征。

Abstract: We present a spectral line analysis of the hot molecular core G10.47+0.03 (hereafter, G10). Our aim is to determine molecular abundances and excitation conditions across a wide spectral range inaccessible to ground-based observatories. We utilize archival data from the Herschel Space Observatory, obtained with the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-Infrared (HIFI). We report here the detection of high-excitation CO, 13CO, and C18O, H2O isotopologues, HCO+, HCN, HNC, CS, C34S, SO, SO2, H2CS, and CH3OH. CO, p-H2O, CS, and HCN show similar velocity profiles with a narrow, blueshifted component, which may be linked to the outer outflow layer. Redshifted wings may indicate inner outflow activity. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework is employed to infer column densities and temperatures accurately. We also performed spectral energy distribution fitting to constrain the global physical parameters of G10, providing essential context for interpreting the molecular emission. The MCMC analysis revealed two excitation temperature components: a warm component (30-65 K) and a hot component (90-250 K). The higher temperatures indicate dense, hot gas typical of massive hot cores. The lower temperatures correspond to the warm, less dense envelope around the core. Transitions of H2O, high-excitation CO, and HCN indicate outflowing gas and high-density shocked regions. These findings highlight G10's complex dynamical environment.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: 本文首次在热分子核G358.93−0.03 MM1中探测到反式甲酸（t-HCOOH）的转动发射线，结合ALMA高分辨率观测与UCLCHEM三相升温化学模型，揭示其主要通过HCO与OH在尘埃表面反应生成并释放至气相。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲酸（HCOOH）是星际介质中合成甘氨酸等有机分子的关键前驱体，其存在暗示含氧分子在恒星形成区（尤其是热核）的化学演化中起重要作用；但此前尚未在热核中明确探测到其反式构型。

Method: 利用ALMA Band 7高分辨率毫米波/亚毫米波观测数据，识别并拟合t-HCOOH转动谱线；通过光谱分析确定柱密度、激发温度和丰度比；采用UCLCHEM气体-尘埃三相升温化学模型模拟HCOOH形成路径与丰度演化。

Result: 首次在G358.93−0.03 MM1中探测到t-HCOOH，测得柱密度为(8.13±0.72)×10¹⁵ cm⁻²，激发温度为120±15 K，相对H₂的丰度为(2.62±0.29)×10⁻⁹；模型与观测丰度吻合良好（偏差因子0.89），支持HCO+OH表面反应为主要形成机制。

Conclusion: t-HCOOH在热核中的存在及其丰度可由尘埃表面HCO与OH反应合理解释，证实甲酸是恒星形成早期阶段关键的表面合成与气相释放分子，对理解复杂有机分子起源具有重要意义。

Abstract: In the interstellar medium, formic acid (HCOOH) plays a significant role in the synthesis of the simplest amino acid, glycine (NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH). The presence of HCOOH suggests that oxygen-bearing molecules may be directly involved in the chemical and physical evolution of star formation regions, particularly in hot molecular cores. This paper presents the first detection of the rotational emission lines of the $trans$-conformer of HCOOH toward the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1, located in the massive star formation region G358.93$-$0.03. This study employed high-resolution observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Band 7. The column density and excitation temperature of $t$-HCOOH are determined as $(8.13\pm0.72)\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $120\pm15$ K, respectively. The fractional abundance of $t$-HCOOH relative to H$_{2}$ is $(2.62\pm 0.29)\times 10^{-9}$. The column density ratios of $t$-HCOOH/CH$_{3}$OH and $t$-HCOOH/H$_{2}$CO are $(1.56 \pm 0.12)\times 10^{-2}$ and $(1.16 \pm 0.12)$, respectively. We computed a three-phase warm-up chemical model of HCOOH using the gas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM. We found that the observed and modelled abundances of HCOOH are almost identical, within a factor of 0.89. Based on chemical modelling, we showed that HCOOH may be formed through the reaction between HCO and OH on the grain surface, which is further released in the gas-phase.

Motivation: 探究NGC 5938中射电辐射的物理起源，区分活动星系核（AGN）活动与恒星形成各自贡献。

Method: 结合EMU射电数据（探测射电喷流及谱指数）、DECaPS2光学、WISE红外和eROSITA X射线多波段观测，开展空间关联与色-色图分析。

Result: 发现一条长约8.2 kpc、谱指数α = -1.2 ± 0.2的射电喷流；WISE显示尘埃与年轻恒星分布于星系盘；X射线亮区包围并邻接射电延伸结构，表明喷流受大尺度热气体晕约束。

Conclusion: NGC 5938中AGN喷流与恒星形成共存，且喷流在星系介质中受到X射线气体晕的准直与限制，类比于Centaurus A等系统，反映AGN反馈与宿主星系介质的紧密耦合。

Abstract: We present multi-wavelength observations of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 5938 (Araish) to investigate the origin of its radio emission, specifically the contribution from active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity and star formation. Using Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) data, we detect extended radio emission extending outwards to the galactic axis, with a steep non-thermal spectral index ($α= -1.2 \pm 0.2$) indicative of synchrotron radiation from an AGN jet. The jet has a physical extent of $\approx 8.2\,kpc$ (angular length of $64^{\prime\prime}$). Multi-wavelength data from The Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey 2 (DECaPS2), Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), and extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) provide further support for this interpretation. The colour-colour diagram presenting WISE infrared observations suggests the presence of dust and young stars that trace the galaxy's disk structure. Our analysis reveals a radio jet, alongside star formation traced by infrared emission, demonstrating the complex interplay of AGN activity and star formation in this well-resolved galaxy. Intriguingly, the spatial relationship reveals the brighter X-ray emission to be largely adjacent to and enveloping the extended radio emission. This suggests that the radio jet, while extending at a significant angle to the galactic disk, is confined by the larger X-ray gas halo, similar to other systems (i.e., ESO 295-IG022, Centaurus A) and may indicate jet collimation and channelling effects.

Motivation: 在耗散系统（如恒星或星系）中，辐射光子与物质解耦，可视为封闭系统的一部分，适用热力学第二定律；但传统熵定义常忽略光子贡献，本文旨在构建包含物质与辐射的全局熵框架，解释结构形成与熵增的统一性。

Method: 采用统计物理方法定义全局熵，将辐射建模为光子气体；分析主序星在赫罗图上的比熵（单位质量熵）与光子产率；推广至星系尺度的恒星形成主序；结合红外/射电波段低频光子主导的河外背景光进行佐证。

Result: 发现主序星在其主序寿命内产生近似相等的比熵和单位质量光子数，表明赫罗图主序是一条‘普适比熵产率’收敛线；星系恒星形成主序亦呈现类似规律；低频光子主导的河外背景光印证了结构通过‘能量切片’（降频辐射）高效产熵。

Conclusion: 宇宙中恒星、星系乃至可能的生命等有序结构，并非违背热力学第二定律，而是其高效熵产机制的体现；熵增驱动结构形成，该视角为理解宇宙演化与地外生命可能性提供了新范式。

Abstract: In a dissipative system such as star or a galaxy, the emitted photons are decoupled from matter particles and may therefore be considered as part of a closed system to which the Second Law of Thermodynamics applies. In the present paper, we define a global entropy using a statistical approach that accounts for the contributions of both matter particles and photons. The statistical contribution of radiation is described as a photon gas in the definition of this global entropy. The increase in global entropy can foster structure formation -- rather than disorder -- because structures such as stars and galaxies are efficient at dissipating energy in the form of photons, and thus at producing entropy. We show that stars generate a nearly equal amount of specific entropy, and therefore a comparable number of photons per unit mass, over their lifetime on the main sequence of the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. This suggests that the main sequence of the HR diagram constitutes a locus of convergence toward a universal specific entropy production by stars. We then examine the implications of this approach for the star-formation main sequence in galaxies, and find a similar result. The emergence of organized structures in cosmic history reflects the second law, as organized matter is efficient at generating entropy through the slicing of energy into lower-frequency photons. This is also reflected in the dominant contribution of low-frequency photons to the extragalactic background light. Finally, we briefly discuss how this perspective may inform us on the possibility of the existence of life elsewhere in the universe.

### [11] [Two-dimensional metallicity distribution of the ionized gas in NGC 628 and NGC 6946](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09675)

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: 本文构建了NGC 628和NGC 6946两个旋涡星系的高方位分辨率H II区星表，通过窄带成像测量Hα、[O II]、[O III]等谱线流量、尺寸、等效宽度及金属丰度，并利用Delaunay三角剖分实现金属丰度二维分布成图，发现高金属丰度团块与旋臂相关，可能源于电离星团温度变化或臂/际间初始质量函数差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旋涡星系中恒星形成过程的空间特性，特别是金属丰度的径向与方位分布规律，弥补以往研究样本量小、空间分辨率低的不足。

Method: 获取Hα、Hβ、[O II]λ3727、[O III]λλ4959,5007及其连续谱窄带图像；进行数据定标与消光改正；对每个H II区提取消光校正后的谱线流量、尺寸、Hα等效宽度；采用两种经验标定法估算氧丰度；利用Delaunay三角剖分构建金属丰度二维分布图。

Result: 获得NGC 628（209个）和NGC 6946（226个）H II区的多参数数据；确认氧丰度径向梯度与先前结果一致但样本更大；两种金属丰度标定结果相差约0.6 dex；首次揭示NGC 628存在高金属丰度团块、NGC 6946存在高金属丰度方位结构，且均与旋臂关联。

Conclusion: H II区金属丰度不仅呈径向梯度，还存在显著的方位非均匀性，其空间分布特征支持电离源性质（如星团温度或IMF）在旋臂与际间存在系统性差异的物理图像。

Abstract: We present here two H II region catalogues with azimuthal resolution for the two grand design galaxies NGC 628 and NGC 6946. With the help of these catalogues, we study several properties of the star-forming processes occurring in spiral galaxies. We obtained direct imaging in the narrow-band filters centred at Hα, H\b{eta}, [O II]λ3727, and [O III]λλ4959, 5007 and their respective continua. After the calibration and correction of the data, we obtained for each H II region the de-reddened fluxes in the aforementioned lines, the size, the Hα equivalent width, and, using two different empirical calibrations, the metallicity. Employing a method based on the Delaunay triangulation, a two-dimensional (2D) representation of the metallicity was obtained. Data for 209 H II regions of NGC 628 and 226 H II regions of NGC 6946 are obtained. The radial behaviours of the Hα equivalent width, the excitation, and the oxygen abundance are derived. Two-dimensional representations of the metallicity and the excitation are calculated for the galaxies in the study. The two empirical calibrations of the metallicity are compared. The oxygen abundance gradients obtained in this study agree with previously published values. However, more regions were examined than in previous studies. We find a difference of about 0.6 dex between the two empirical calibrations employed. Finally, the 2D representations of the metallicity reveal high metallicity knots in NGC 628, and for NGC 6946 a high metallicity azimuthal structure is discovered. These high metallicity regions seem to be linked to the arms of the galaxies and are probably produced by an increase in the temperature of the ionizing clusters in the H II regions, which may be linked to variations in the initial mass functions of the galaxies between the arm and interarm regions.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: 本研究通过90组N体数值模拟，评估了年轻大质量星团（YMC）演化为老年疏散星团（OC）这一通道对引力波（GW）致密双星并合事件的贡献，发现该通道可解释约25%-33%的观测并合率，并再现部分关键观测特征（如低质量比、自旋错向、~30倍太阳质量黑洞等），但低估了~10倍太阳质量黑洞的产生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVK引力波探测揭示致密双星并合存在多种形成通道，需定量评估YMC/OC通道的贡献及其能否解释观测到的并合事件特征。

Method: 采用直接积分、含后牛顿修正的N体代码NBODY7，构建涵盖初始质量、半质量半径和金属丰度的90组星团模型；包含原初双星、延迟致密残骸形成、黑洞自旋设定及引力波反冲等物理过程，并演化至黑洞耗尽。

Result: YMC/OC通道可产生大量动力学组装的双黑洞并合事件，质量比低至0.1–0.2；并合效率在初始星团质量~7.5×10⁴M⊙及≤3.0×10⁴M⊙处出现峰值；模型能复现部分观测特征（如不对称低质量并合、高自旋大质量黑洞的错向并合、30M⊙主星过剩），但低估10M⊙主星；并合率密度占观测值25%–33%，且随红移增长略快于恒星形成率；有效自旋分布呈零红移正偏态，随红移展宽；同时生成与Gaia发现一致的场星黑洞/中子星-主序星双星。

Conclusion: YMC/OC通道是引力波并合的重要形成机制之一，能解释观测中多项关键统计特征，但需与其他通道（如孤立双星演化）共同作用才能完整再现整体观测样本。

Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) detections by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observatories suggest multiple formation channels for GW compact binary mergers. Here I assess the role of young massive clusters (YMC) evolving into old open clusters (OC) -- the YMC/OC channel -- to the GW merger population. A homogeneous grid of 90 N-body evolutionary model star clusters, spanning initial masses of $10^4M_\odot\leq M_{cl}(0)\leq10^5M_\odot$, half-mass radii of 1-3 pc, and metallicities between 0.0002-0.02 is computed with the direct, post-Newtonian N-body code NBODY7. The N-body simulations include primordial binaries, delayed stellar-remnant model forming black holes (BH) and neutron stars (NS), BH spin prescriptions, and GW recoil kicks, and they are evolved until BH depletion. Most GW mergers from the cluster models are dynamically assembled binary black holes (BBH) that merge within their host clusters. Merger mass ratios reach down to 0.1-0.2 despite an overall bias toward nearly symmetric pairs. The GW merger efficiency varies non-monotonically with cluster mass, peaking around $M_{cl}(0)=7.5\times10^4M_\odot$ and also for $M_{cl}(0)\leq3.0\times10^4M_\odot$. The computed mergers reproduce some of the key features of the latest observed GW event catalogue, including asymmetric low-mass mergers, misaligned events among highly spinning, massive BHs, and an excess of $30M_\odot$ primaries, though they under-produce $10M_\odot$ primaries, hinting at contributions from other channels. The model merger rate density accounts for 25%-33% of the observed rate; it increases with redshift somewhat faster than the cosmic star formation, consistently with LVK's inferences. The model effective spin distribution is positively asymmetric at zero redshift and broadens with redshift. The models yield field BH- and NS-main sequence star binaries with parameters consistent with the Gaia-discovered candidates. [Abgd.]

Result: 发现一批总恒星质量≥10¹¹ M⊙、具双指数盘结构的星系；其暗物质晕质量≈10¹² M⊙，最大旋转速度≈300–500 km/s，恒星/暗物质及重子/暗物质质量比分别在0.04–0.46与0.07–0.47范围内。

Conclusion: IllustrisTNG50模拟能成功形成与观测一致的双指数盘星系，支持当前星系形成模型对复杂盘结构的物理刻画能力。

Abstract: We study massive disk galaxies (total stellar mass$>=10^{11}$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) from IllustrisTNG50 simulation, and perform 2-D structural decomposition of the galaxies using their idealised, synthetic SDSS images for z=0. We find an interesting sample of galaxies having a central high surface brightness (HSB) stellar disk, surrounded by an extended low surface brightness (LSB) stellar disk, similar to giant LSB galaxies. These massive, double-exponential disk galaxies are found to be hosted by dark matter haloes of $\sim 10^{12} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ in agreement to observations of such galaxies. Their maximum rotation velocity, an approximate measure of their dynamical mass, lies within $\sim$ (300-500) km/s. The stellar-to-dark matter mass ratio and the baryon-to-dark matter mass ratio of the sample lies in the range of $\sim$ (0.04 - 0.46) and $\sim$ (0.07 - 0.47) respectively. Our results show that cosmological simulations are able to form disc galaxies with HSB plus LSB disks, as in observations.

TL;DR: 本研究利用MUSE积分场光谱观测，分析了棒旋星系NGC 1097核周恒星形成环中24个HII区的物理性质，发现其具有迄今报道的最高金属丰度（超太阳5倍），揭示了高金属丰度下电离参数与[SII]/[SIII]比值关系的断裂，并支持由核区出发、经棒驱动激波传播的恒星爆发模型，同时可能探测到喷流的光学特征，表明小尺度上存在反馈过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NGC 1097的核周恒星形成环是研究极端条件下恒星形成的独特实验室；需厘清其电离机制、金属丰度特性、电离结构变化及恒星形成驱动机制。

Method: 基于MUSE积分场光谱数据，识别并分析环内24个电离HII区；采用直接方法测定丰度；结合光致电离模型解释谱线比异常；综合多波段结果探讨恒星形成传播机制及反馈迹象。

Conclusion: NGC 1097核周环处于极端高金属丰度环境，其电离结构和谱线行为偏离常规经验关系；恒星形成受局地气体供给调控，并由核区经棒驱动过程传播；小尺度（亚秒差距至千秒差距）上存在活跃的反馈过程，包括喷流与星暴的共同作用。

Abstract: The circumnuclear star-forming ring of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 1097 provides a unique laboratory to study star formation under extreme conditions. This work aims to derive the physical properties of the circumnuclear star-forming regions (CNSFRs) using MUSE integral field spectroscopy observations. A total of 24 individual ionised HII are identified and analysed within its ring, which spans from $\sim$385 pc to $\sim$1.3 kpc. Despite the complex nuclear activity, all HII regions are found to be purely photoionised. Directly derived abundances reveal supersolar metallicities, with the highest one exceeding five times the solar value (12+log(S/H) = 7.875 $\pm$ 0.353, T$_e$([SIII]) = 3912 $\pm$ 567 K), and representing the highest abundance reported to date. In this high-metallicity regime, we find a break in the ionisation parameter-[SII]/[SIII] relation, which can be explained by changes in the ionisation structure and line emissivities, as confirmed by photoionisation models that successfully reproduce the observed emission-line ratios. Our results also indicate that the local gas supply regulates the star formation activity within the ring, with the young stars ionising 8 % of the total gas in the ring. Furthermore, our findings support a propagating starburst scenario, originating in the galaxy nucleus and extending towards the ends of the bar and into the circumnuclear ring through bar-driven shocks, this being consistent with the results of previous multi-wavelength studies. Finally, we likely detect optical signatures associated with one of the two known jets in this galaxy. This finding, together with the radio core emission previously found at sub-parsec scales, reflects the presence of feedback processes operating even on small galactic disc scales.

Motivation: 为获得行星状星云Helix Nebula高空间分辨率、宽波段、均匀采样的光谱数据，以深入理解其电离结构、物理条件和动力学特性。

Method: 使用SDSS-V LVM在3600–9800 Å波段获取的连续约0.5度视场数据，结合LVM-DAP进行空间分辨光谱分析，提取发射线流量、运动学和线比图，并检测微弱禁戒线（如[O III] 4363、[N II] 5755、He I等）用于物理参数诊断。

Abstract: We present a spatially resolved spectroscopic analysis of the Helix Nebula (NGC 7293) using data from the SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper (LVM), by applying the recently developed LVM Data Analysis Pipeline (LVM-DAP). Covering the full optical range (3600-9800 Å) over a contiguous ~ 0.5 degree field, the LVM data provide the first hexagonally sampled, wide-field emission-line maps of all major ionic species in this archetypal planetary nebula. The resulting flux, kinematic, and line-ratio maps reveal the well-known ionization stratification of the nebula, from the compact He++ core to the bright [O III] ring and the extended low-ionization envelope, enabling a detailed comparison with classical aperture spectroscopy. Owing to the sensitivity and uniform spatial sampling of the LVM, numerous faint auroral and diagnostic lines are detected across the nebula, including [O III] 4363, [N II] 5755, and He I lines, allowing precise measurements of weak-line morphology. The derived radial trends confirm the remarkably low dust content and the overall homogeneity of electron temperature and density across the main ring. Ionized-gas kinematics traced by Hα further support the scenario of a slowly expanding, limb-brightened shell consistent with previous studies. This work demonstrates the diagnostic power of LVM spectroscopy for extended nebulae and highlights its capability to recover both global and spatially resolved physical conditions across complex ionized structures.

TL;DR: 本文通过云破碎模拟研究了数值分辨率对云生存和加速的影响，发现不同物理场景下所需的分辨率不同：亚音速辐射冷却情况下4个网格即可收敛，而超音速情况下即使48个网格仍未收敛，表明云破坏比云增长更依赖高分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数值模拟中混合速率对最小可分辨尺度敏感，但分辨率与云演化的关系尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用一系列云破碎（cloud-crushing）数值模拟，涵盖绝热与辐射冷却、亚音速与超音速风等不同情形，系统分析分辨率（以每云半径网格数表征）对云质量演化和速度变化的影响，并构建简单模型解释早期激波压强驱动冷云加速的机制。

Result: 云生存与加速确实依赖数值分辨率；亚音速辐射情形在4 cells/云半径即收敛；超音速情形下云破坏与速度仍随分辨率升高而显著变化，48 cells/云半径仍未收敛；提出早期ram pressure主导加速、随后混合起主导作用的两阶段加速模型。

Conclusion: 不存在适用于所有云-风相互作用场景的统一分辨率要求；准确刻画云破坏比刻画云增长需要更高分辨率；需根据具体物理条件（如马赫数、冷却效率）选择适当分辨率。

Abstract: Mixing by hydrodynamical instabilities plays a key role in cloud-wind interactions, causing cloud destruction in the adiabatic limit and facilitating cloud survival with efficient radiative cooling. However, the rate of mixing in numerical simulations is sensitive to the smallest resolved scale, and the relationship between resolution and cloud evolution is under-explored. Using a set of cloud-crushing simulations, we investigate the effects of numerical resolution on cloud survival and acceleration. Modeling both adiabatic and radiative cases, in a subsonic and supersonic wind, we find that cloud survival and velocity does depend on the numerical resolution, however, no single resolution requirement can be applied to all scenarios. In the radiative subsonic case, we find that mass growth and acceleration appear converged at only 4 cells per cloud radius. Conversely, in the supersonic regime, we see a clear dependence of cloud destruction and velocity on resolution that is not converged even at 48 cells per cloud radius, implying that accurately capturing cloud destruction may require higher resolution than capturing growth. We also present a simple model illustrating how ram pressure accelerates cool clouds at early times before mixing kicks in as an acceleration mechanism.

Motivation: LISA将高信噪比观测超大质量黑洞双星，但参数估计易受波形误差影响，尤其高阶模式被忽略带来的系统误差。

Method: 扩展Yi等人先前工作，分析具有非零对齐自旋、总质量达10^8 M⊙的MBHBs中忽略高阶模式所引起的误差，并提出改进的似然优化方案。

Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with astoundingly high signal-to-noise ratio, leaving parameter estimation with these signals susceptible to seemingly small waveform errors. Of particular concern for MBHBs are errors due to neglected higher-order modes. We extend Yi et al. [arXiv:2502.12237] to examine errors due to neglected higher-order modes for MBHBs with nonzero (aligned) progenitor spins and total mass up to $10^8\,M_\odot$. For these very massive systems, there can be regions of parameter space in which the $(\ell, |m|)=(2,\,2)$ modes are no longer dominant with respect to higher-order ones. We find that the extent of systematic bias can change significantly when varying the progenitor spins of the binary. We also find that for the heaviest, and therefore shortest, MBHB signals, slight systematic errors can cause severe mis-inference of the sky localization parameters. We propose an improved likelihood optimization scheme with respect to previous work as a way to predict these effects in a computationally efficient manner.

Abstract: According to current theory a black hole has a nonzero temperature and thus radiates like any black body. This remarkable result was first shown by Hawking for a non-spinning black hole using general relativity to describe the black hole gravitational field and quantum field theory to describe the radiation. Since then the temperature of a spinning Kerr black hole has been calculated. There have also been many heuristic derivations for the temperature. In this work we derive the temperature of a Kerr spinning black hole using only classical general relativity and thermodynamics. It is very similar to Ref. 11 but is mathematically simpler and more self-contained. Our purpose is mainly pedagogical, to be more accessible to students and non-specialists with a knowledge of general relativity. We also call further attention to the expected explosive evaporation of small black holes, not yet observed, which would be an almost unique window into Planck scale physics. Finally, we discuss the idea that the cosmological dark matter, whose nature is currently unknown, may be composed of small primordial black hole remnants.

Abstract: Random tensor models can be used as combinatorial devices to generate Euclidean dynamical triangulations. A physical continuum limit of dynamical triangulations requires a suitable generalization of the double-scaling limit of random matrices. This limit corresponds to a fixed point of a pregeometric Renormalization Group flow in which the tensor size $N$ serves as the Renormalization Group scale. We search for corresponding fixed points in order-4 random tensor models associated to dynamical triangulations in 4 dimensions. In a $O(N)^{\otimes 4}$ symmetric setting, we discuss the resulting phase portrait as a function of the regulator parameters. We optimize our results, identifying parameter values for which the results are minimally sensitive to parameter changes. We find three fixed-point candidates: only one of them is real across the entire parameter range, but only has two relevant directions. This should be contrasted with the university class of the Reuter fixed point in continuum quantum gravity, very likely characterized by three relevant directions. We conclude that simple combinatorial models of Euclidean triangulations and the Reuter fixed point most likely lie in different universality classes.

TL;DR: This paper studies how a uniform magnetic field affects the orbital dynamics and gravitational wave emission of objects orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole in the Schwarzschild-Bertotti-Robinson spacetime, showing observable imprints on GW signals detectable by future space-based detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how intrinsic magnetic fields alter black hole spacetime geometry and leave observable signatures in gravitational wave signals from extreme mass-ratio inspirals.

Method: Analysis of timelike geodesics (MBO, ISCO), frequency ratio ω_φ/ω_r for periodic bound orbits, numerical kludge method for GW waveform generation, discrete Fourier transform for characteristic strain computation, comparison with LISA/Taiji/TianQin sensitivity curves.

Result: The background magnetic field significantly modifies orbital frequencies, resonance conditions, zoom-whirl behavior, and GW waveforms; mHz-range GW spectra show detectable deviations due to magnetic field effects.

Conclusion: Intrinsically magnetic fields induce measurable changes in spacetime structure and GW signals, offering a new observational probe for astrophysical magnetic environments around supermassive black holes.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate periodic bound orbits and gravitational wave (GW) emission in the Schwarzschild-Bertotti-Robinson (Schwarzschild-BR) spacetime-an exact electrovacuum solution describing a static black hole (BH) immersed in a uniform magnetic field. We explore how the background magnetic field qualitatively alters the BH's gravitational dynamics, affecting timelike geodesics such as the marginally bound orbit (MBO) and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). We then analyze periodic bound orbits using the frequency ratio ${ω_{\varphi}}/{ω_{r}}$, which characterizes the orbits by their azimuthal and radial motions. Based on the numerical kludge method we further compute the gravitational waveforms emitted from periodic orbits around a supermassive Schwarzschild-BR BH. We show that the background magnetic field significantly changes orbital frequencies, resonance conditions, zoom-whirl structures, and the resulting waveforms. Finally, we examine the frequency spectra in the mHz range and the detectability of these GW signals by computing the characteristic strain via a discrete Fourier transform on the time-domain waveforms, comparing the results with the sensitivity curves of space-based GW detectors such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin. Our results show that intrinsically magnetic fields modify spacetime and leave observable imprints on extreme mass-ratio inspiral GWs, which may be tested by future observations.

### [21] [Constraints on Interacting Early Dark Energy from a Modified Temperature-Redshift Relation and CMB Acoustic Scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09498)
*Y Bisabr*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 本文研究了早期暗能量标量场与辐射在再复合前的耦合，通过能量交换修改了宇宙微波背景温度-红移关系，并分析其对声视界和角声学尺度的影响，最终利用Planck数据对耦合强度给出一致性约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决哈勃常数在早期与晚期宇宙测量中持续存在的张力问题，探索标准宇宙学模型在再复合前物理的扩展。

Method: 构建一个早期暗能量标量场与辐射相互作用的模型，推导修正后的背景温度演化方程，并在紧耦合近似下研究线性标量扰动；分析该相互作用对声视界及CMB角声学尺度的影响。

Result: 该相互作用显著改变再复合时的声视界，从而影响CMB角声学尺度；利用Planck对声学尺度的观测约束，得到耦合强度的严格上限，表明温度-红移关系的偏离受到强限制。

Conclusion: 尽管该早期暗能量-辐射耦合模型可缓解哈勃张力，但当前CMB观测（特别是Planck声学尺度）已对其参数空间施加严苛限制，难以提供显著改进，且未引入新的扰动自由度。

Abstract: The Hubble tension, reflecting a persistent discrepancy between early- and late-time determinations of the Hubble constant, continues to motivate extensions of the standard cosmological model The Hubble tension motivates extensions of the standard cosmological model that modify pre-recombination physics. In this work we study an early dark energy scalar field coupled to radiation prior to recombination. The interaction leads to energy exchange between the two components and modifies the standard cosmic microwave background temperature redshift relation.
  We derive the modified temperature evolution from the background equations and interpret it in terms of effective photon non-conservation. We also study linear scalar perturbations in the tight-coupling regime relevant for cosmic microwave background acoustic physics. We show that the interaction affects the background evolution without introducing new dynamical degrees of freedom at the perturbation level.
  The dominant observational effect arises through a shift in the sound horizon at recombination, which modifies the angular acoustic scale. Using the Planck constraint on the acoustic scale we obtain a consistency bound on the coupling strength and show that deviations from the standard temperature redshift relation are tightly constrained.

### [22] [Dynamical Dark Energy Signatures from a New Transition $Om(z)$ Parametrization in Flat FLRW Cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09525)
*Manish Yadav,Archana Dixit,Anirudh Pradhan,M. S. Barak*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的Om(z)诊断参数化形式Om(z)=z^l/(1+z)^m，利用OHD、Pantheon Plus和SH0ES数据，在FLRW框架下通过MCMC方法约束参数{H0,l,m}，发现Om(z)斜率在特定红移处由负转正，暗示暗能量从精质相向幻影相演化，并得到与SH0ES一致的H0值（73.01±0.36 km/s/Mpc）及宇宙年龄约13–14 Gyr。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探测ΛCDM模型的偏差，研究暗能量的动力学演化行为，特别是其状态方程随红移的变化趋势。

Method: 采用新提出的Om(z) = z^l/(1+z)^m 参数化形式，在空间平坦FLRW宇宙学框架下，结合OHD、Pantheon Plus和SH0ES观测数据，使用emcee进行MCMC参数估计。

Result: 发现Om(z)斜率在z_t ≈ 0.33（OHD+PP&SH0ES）等红移处由负变正，表明暗能量由quintessence-like相转向phantom相；H0 = 73.01 ± 0.36 km/s/Mpc；宇宙年龄约13–14 Gyr；减速-加速转变红移z_t ∈ [0.5, 0.8]。

Conclusion: 该Om(z)新参数化能有效刻画宇宙演化阶段性特征，支持动态暗能量模型，且与当前高精度局部H0测量一致，为超越ΛCDM的模型提供了新约束路径。

Abstract: We investigate a cosmic scenario using a new transition parameterization of the $Om(z)$ diagnostic, $Om(z) = \frac{z^l}{(1+z)^m}$, in the spatially flat Friedmann Lemaître Robertson-Walker (FLRW) framework. Using observational datasets such as Observational Hubble Data (OHD), Pantheon Plus (PP), and SH0ES, we analyze the evolution of the $Om(z)$ function to probe deviations from the standard $Λ$CDM model and constrain free parameter space {$H_0$, l, m } using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis with the emcee sampler. Our analysis reveals a clear transition in the slope of $Om(z)$ from negative to positive at transition redshift values $z_t \approx 1.41$, $0.65$, and $0.33$ for the OHD, OHD+PP, and OHD+PP$\&$SH0ES datasets, respectively. This behavior suggests a dynamical evolution of dark energy, indicating a transition from a quintessence-like phase to a phantom regime. From the combined OHD+PP$\&$SH0ES dataset, we obtain a best-fit value of the Hubble constant \( H_0 = 73.01 \pm 0.36 \, \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}} \), which is consistent with the SH0ES calibration and supports the viability of our model. Additionally, our analysis indicates that the current age of the Universe is approximately $13 \sim 14$ Gyr from all available combinations of datasets, which is consistent with observational expectations. Further, we find that the deceleration-to-acceleration transition, which marks the beginning of cosmic acceleration, is inferred to occur within the redshift interval $z_t \in [0.5, 0.8]$, highlighting the emergence of dark energy as the dominant component in the Universe's recent expansion history. Our transition $Om(z)$ parameterization captured progressive cosmological changes and enabled seamless interpolation over cosmic epochs.

Conclusion: 所提出的基于分界发散结构的插值与重求和策略，能有效连接弱场与强场极限，为构建统一的黑洞双星辐射模型提供了新途径。

Abstract: Motivated by recent efforts to bridge between weak-field and strong-field descriptions of black-hole binary dynamics, we develop a resummation scheme for post-Minkowskian radiative observables in extreme-mass-ratio scattering, augmented with post-Newtonian terms. Specifically, we derive universal interpolation formulas for the total energy emitted in gravitational waves out to infinity and down the event horizon of the large black hole, valid to leading order in the small mass ratio. We test our formulas using numerical results from direct calculations in black hole perturbation theory. The central idea of our approach is to utilize as a strong-field diagnostic the known form of divergence in the radiated energy along geodesics near the parameter-space separatrix between scattering and plunge. The dominant, logarithmic term of this divergence can be expressed in terms of instantaneous energy fluxes calculated along the unstable circular geodesics that form the separatrix, fluxes that we obtain using interpolation of highly accurate numerical data. The same idea could be applied to bound-orbit radiative observables via either unbound-to-bound mapping or a direct resummation of bound-orbit post-Newtonian expressions.

### [26] [Modeling Redshift Uncertainties in Roman Weak Lensing Cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09230)
*Diogo H. F. de Souza,Boyan Yin,Tim Eifler,Vivian Miranda,Chun-Hao To,Brett H. Andrews,Katarina Markovič,Eric Huff,Michael A. Troxel,Olivier Doré*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于主成分分析（PCA）的优化方法，用于建模Roman空间望远镜弱引力透镜观测中星系红移分布的不确定性，并在CoCoA管道中实现与验证；结果表明，该方法在红移分布存在中至强系统偏差时能有效缓解宇宙学参数S8和Ωm的偏差，且参数效率优于传统九层均值偏移模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Roman空间望远镜的宇宙学约束需精准建模星系红移分布（n(z)）的不确定性，尤其在弱引力透镜分析中，n(z)误差易导致S8和Ωm等关键宇宙学参数的系统性偏差。

Method: 采用优化的主成分分析（PCA）方法建模n(z)整体形状的不确定性，并集成到Roman HLIS Cosmology PIT的CoCoA（Cobaya-Cosmolike Joint Architecture）分析流程中；通过Cardinal生成多组不同Roman配置下的红移分布模拟数据，对比PCA方法与传统均值偏移法对参数偏差的抑制能力。

Result: 在红移分布轻度误校准时，PCA与均值偏移法给出一致的S8和Ωm约束；在中至强误校准下，增加主成分数量可逐步消除S8和Ωm偏差，且仅需少于9个参数即达到与九层均值偏移模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: PCA是一种高效、鲁棒的n(z)不确定性建模方法，适用于Roman任务的高精度宇宙学分析，有望成为未来弱透镜巡天的标准工具之一。

Abstract: Cosmological constraints using weak gravitational lensing measurements from the Roman Space Telescope will require a powerful method for modelling uncertainties in the galaxy redshift distribution. In this work, we use an optimized version of the principal component analysis (PCA) to model uncertainties in the full shape of the redshift distributions, a method proposed by \cite{pca_method} and recently used in the Dark Energy Survey Y6 analysis. Here, we implement this new approach within the Roman High Latitude Imaging Survey (HLIS) Cosmology Project Infrastructure Team (PIT) pipeline, namely Cobaya-Cosmolike Joint Architecture (\texttt{CoCoA}). To validate the PCA in mitigating biases on cosmological parameters, $S_8$ and $Ω_m$, we use a set of redshift distributions from \texttt{Cardinal} generated for a variety of Roman configurations. Overall, when the simulated cosmic shear data vector is not strongly miscalibrated relative to the fiducial one, both the mean-shift and the PCA-based approaches produce consistent cosmological constraints when marginalizing over nuisance parameters. For mild to strong miscalibration, including additional PCs progressively mitigates biases in $S_8$ and $Ω_m$, and can achieve comparable performance with fewer parameters than the nine tomographic-bin mean-shift model.

Abstract: Recently, Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) observations found 12 candidates for microlensing events. These events can be explained by primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses of $10^{-7}$-$10^{-6} M_\odot$ and a fraction of all dark matter of $f_\mathrm{PBH} = \mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. In this paper, we consider the PBH production in two types of the axionlike curvaton models, which predict an enhancement of the curvature perturbations on small scales. We show that the microlensing events can be explained in the axionlike curvaton model and discuss the cosmological implications such as gravitational waves.

Method: 构建一个受分子物理中Lennard-Jones势启发的修正势函数，其具有大场值下的平坦平台和光滑极小值；系统求解慢滚动力学，计算标量谱指数n_s、张量比r及谱指数跑动α_s，并与Planck、ACT等最新宇宙微波背景观测数据对比。

Result: 模型给出的标量谱指数n_s与CMB数据完全一致；张量比极低（r∼10⁻⁷）；谱指数跑动α_s也很小，处于Atacama Cosmology Telescope最新1σ观测限内。

Conclusion: 修正Lennard-Jones势提供了一种新颖、自洽且高度简约的单场暴胀实现路径，可在不引入额外自由度或复杂相互作用的前提下，自然满足当前最严格的原初引力波和标量扰动观测约束。

Abstract: The increasingly stringent observational bounds on primordial gravitational waves strongly constrain inflationary model building, favoring scenarios that predict highly suppressed tensor perturbations. While many viable constructions rely on non-canonical kinetic terms, non-minimal couplings, or modifications of gravity, it remains an open question whether comparably small tensor amplitudes can emerge within a minimal, single-field framework driven solely by potential dynamics. In this work we propose a novel inflationary scenario based on a modified Lennard-Jones potential. Inspired by a well-known interaction potential in molecular physics, the proposed form naturally combines a smooth minimum with an extended flat plateau at large field values. This intrinsic structure supports slow-roll inflation and ensures a graceful exit without introducing additional degrees of freedom. We perform a detailed analysis of the inflationary dynamics and confront the model with current observational constraints. We find that the scalar spectral index is fully consistent with CMB data, while the tensor-to-scalar ratio is predicted to be extremely small, reaching values as low as $r\sim10^{-7}$. Finally, the running of the scalar spectral index is also found to be small, well withing the 1$σ$ recent observational bounds from Atacama Cosmology Telescope.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DESI 2024等最新观测显示暗能量状态方程可能穿越幻影边界（w < -1），挑战标准ΛCDM及传统最小耦合标量场模型（包括原始Running Curvaton），亟需能统一描述早期暴胀与晚期加速膨胀且兼容新数据的理论框架。

Result: 模型可自然实现w₀ > -1、wₐ < 0的动力学行为，显著改善对DESI观测轮廓的拟合；原初谱指数n_s与局域型非高斯参数f_NL严格保持与Planck数据一致；稳定性分析确认c_s² = 1，无鬼模与梯度不稳定性。

Conclusion: 非最小耦合的Running Curvaton模型是一个稳定、自洽且统一的框架，能同时满足早期宇宙暴胀与晚期暗能量动力学的最新高精度观测约束。

Abstract: Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024, combined with CMB and SNIa data, indicate a preference for a dynamical dark energy equation of state that crosses the phantom divide ($w < -1$). This finding challenges the standard $Λ$CDM model and minimally coupled scalar field scenarios, including the original Running Curvaton model, which is typically constrained to the quintessence regime. In this work, we propose a unified cosmological framework by extending the Running Curvaton model via a non-minimal gravitational coupling of the form $ξχ^2 R$. We demonstrate that this geometric modification allows the effective equation of state to naturally evolve from a quintessence-like to a phantom-like regime in the Jordan frame, thereby providing a superior fit to the DESI observational contours ($w_0 > -1, w_a < 0$). Crucially, we show that the introduction of non-minimal coupling does not compromise the model's success in describing the early universe. Through a parameter re-tuning mechanism involving the coupling constant ($g_0^{obs} = g_0 + 2ξ$), the predictions for the primordial power spectrum (spectral index $n_s$) and local-type non-Gaussianity ($f_{NL}$) remain strictly preserved and consistent with Planck data. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive stability analysis within the Horndeski framework, verifying that the model remains free from ghost and gradient instabilities ($c_s^2 = 1$). Our results suggest that the non-minimally coupled Running Curvaton offers a robust, stable, and unified description of inflation and late-time accelerated expansion compatible with the latest precision cosmology data.

Motivation: 提升宇宙剪切测量精度以更严格检验ΛCDM模型，并厘清本征对齐（IA）与重子反馈等系统误差对S8约束的影响。

Method: 使用DES Y6数据，将星系分为4个红移bin，采用盲分析框架；建模剪切与红移标定误差，剔除小尺度数据以规避重子效应；分别采用NLA和TATT两种IA模型；通过贝叶斯推断获取S8等宇宙学参数。

Conclusion: DES Y6宇宙剪切结果达到当前地面巡天最高精度，验证了方法鲁棒性，表明IA建模和尺度截断是S8不确定性的主要来源，为下一代巡天奠定基础。

Abstract: We present legacy cosmic shear measurements and cosmological constraints using six years of Dark Energy Survey imaging data. From these data, we study ~140 million galaxies (8.29 galaxies/arcmin$^2$) that are 50% complete at i=24.0 and extend beyond z=1.2. We divide the galaxies into four redshift bins, and obtain cosmic shear measurement with a signal-to-noise of 83, a factor of 2 higher than the Year 3 analysis. We model the uncertainties due to shear and redshift calibrations, and discard measurements on small angular scales to mitigate baryon feedback and other small-scale uncertainties. We consider two fiducial models to account for the intrinsic alignment (IA) of the galaxies. We conduct a blind analysis in the context of the $Λ$CDM model and find $S_8 \equiv σ_8(Ω_m/0.3)^{0.5}=0.798^{+0.014}_{-0.015}$ (marginalized mean with 68% CL) when using the non-linear alignment model (NLA) and $S_{8} = 0.783^{+0.019}_{-0.015}$ with the tidal alignment and tidal torque model (TATT), providing 1.8% and 2.5% uncertainty on $S_8$. Compared to constraints from the cosmic microwave background from Planck 2018, ACT DR6 and SPT-3G DR1, we find consistency in the full parameter space at 1.1$σ$ (1.7$σ$) and in $S_8$ at 2.0$σ$ (2.3$σ$) for NLA (TATT). The result using the NLA model is preferred according to the Bayesian evidence. We find that the model choice for IA and baryon feedback can impact the value of our $S_8$ constraint up to $1σ$. For our fiducial model choices, the resultant uncertainties in $S_8$ are primarily degraded by the removal of scales, as well as the marginalization over the IA parameters. We demonstrate that our result is internally consistent and robust to different choices in calibrating the data, owing to methodological improvements in shear and redshift measurement, laying the foundation for next-generation cosmic shear programs.

TL;DR: 本文利用南极望远镜（SPT）等多频段CMB数据，通过线性组合技术构建多种Compton-y图，首次在arcminute尺度上高显著性（9.3σ）测量了热Sunyaev-Zeldovich（tSZ）效应的全形功率谱，并探测到tSZ与宇宙红外背景（CIB）之间具有3.1σ显著性的尺度依赖交叉相关。

Motivation: 精确测量tSZ功率谱有助于理解星系团物理、反馈机制及星系际介质模型；但受CIB等前景污染严重，需发展稳健的多频分离方法并量化残余相关。

Method: 融合SPT-3G（95/150/220 GHz）、SPTpol（150 GHz）和Herschel-SPIRE（600/857 GHz）数据，采用线性组合（LC）生成最小方差（MV）和CIB最小化（CIB-min）Compton-y图；测量其自/互功率谱（ℓ=500–5000），并通过MV与CIB-min谱差重构tSZ×CIB交叉相关系数ρℓ。

Result: tSZ功率谱以9.3σ显著性测得，与文献结果一致；首次获得3.1σ证据表明tSZ与CIB存在正向尺度依赖交叉相关（大尺度显著，ℓ>2500趋近零）。

Conclusion: 该工作产出迄今最深的tSZ图，为约束天体物理反馈与ICM模型提供了新观测依据；证实tSZ-CIB交叉相关不可忽略，对未来CMB和SZ巡天的数据分析具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: We present a measurement of the full shape of the power spectrum of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect down to arcminute scales using cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) over roughly 100 ${\rm deg}^{2}$ field. The analysis incorporates data from the 2019/20 seasons of the SPT-3G survey in bands centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz; from the full SPTpol dataset at 150 GHz; and from {\it Herschel}-SPIRE survey in bands centered at 600 and 857 GHz. We combine data from all the above bands using linear combination (LC) techniques to produce a tSZ or Compton-$y$ map. We modify the LC weights to produce multiple versions of the Compton-$y$ map, including minimum-variance (MV) and foreground-minimized (-min) maps. We measure the auto- and cross-spectra of a subset of these maps in the range $\ell \in [500, 5000]$. While this power spectrum includes contributions from signals other than tSZ, we present numerous checks to show that the most challenging foreground signal, the cosmic infrared background (CIB) is much lower than the desired tSZ signal in the scales of interest in this work. The final tSZ power spectrum is measured at $9.3σ$ with both the MV and CIB-min maps. Our results are consistent with those reported in other CMB surveys across the literature. Using the difference in the tSZ power spectrum from MV and CIB-min maps, we reconstruct the scale-dependent tSZ-CIB cross-correlation $ρ_{\ell}^{\rm tSZ \times CIB}$, finding $3.1σ$ evidence for a nonzero correlation coefficient that is positive on large scales and approaches zero for $\ell > 2500$. This result represents the deepest tSZ maps ever produced and provides new constraints that can help refine astrophysical feedback mechanisms and models of the intracluster medium.
