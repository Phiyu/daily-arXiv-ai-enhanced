We adopt a unified framework capable of describing both relativistic and non-relativistic particles, as well as fast and slow decay regimes. Within this approach, we model exponential, power-law, oscillatory, and two-step decays, computing the resulting $μ$- and $y$-type distortions across the parameter space spanned by the confinement scale $a_c$, decay rate $Γ_χ$, energy-transfer efficiency $Σ_χ$, and velocity $v_{χc}$. We find that power-law, oscillatory, and cascade decays can be effectively mapped onto exponential models with appropriate rescaling. The dominant factors controlling SDs are the decay epoch and lifetime, with $v_{χc}$ becoming relevant only in the ultra-relativistic limit. FIRAS observations impose tight constraints on early energy injection, with $μ$-type distortions placing the strongest bounds on $Σ_χ$. Simultaneous matching of both $μ_{\\rm firas}$ and $y_{\\rm firas}$ breaks the degeneracy between $Γ_χ$ and $Σ_χ$, localizing preferred decay rates around $Γ_χ\\lesssim (3.3-4.4)\\times10^{-3}~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$ and $Σ_χ\\lesssim 8.5\\times10^{-4}$ for relativistic particles, while fast decays with $Γ_χ\\gtrsim 6.5~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$ become observationally negligible. Our results show that CMB spectral distortions are a powerful probe of dark-sector dynamics. Future missions such as PIXIE or PRISM could extend current limits by several orders of magnitude and test previously inaccessible regions of parameter space."}

We present new JWST observations of this system, revealing warm H$_2$ gas that is co-spatial with the cold molecular gas traced by CO, extending over 30 kpc around the BCG in a tail-like structure reaching into the circumgalactic medium of this galaxy. Analysis of the mid-infrared pure H$_2$ rotational lines H$_2$S(1), H$_2$S(5), and H$_2$S(9) indicate warm gas temperatures of $515.6 \\pm 0.8$ K and $535.2\\pm 1.9$ K in the BCG and tail regions, respectively.

Recognizing that black hole mass variation is inherently a continuous and dynamic process, but the extended timescales required for such variations allow us, to employ a static, frame-by-frame approach. We're assuming constant mass within individual frames, while permitting inter-frame mass evolution to prob the effects of mass loss on orbital dynamics. Using this method, we investigate whether the Periapsis Shift in the extremal limit can serve as evidence for the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC), addressing the conjecture's role in preserving black hole integrity during evaporation. Subsequently, we analyze the Periapsis Shift under Aschenbach-like conditions, where a stable photon sphere generates non-monotonic orbital velocity profiles, to assess its dynamical impact on relativistic precession. Finally, we synthesize the combined effects of extremality and the presence of stable photon sphere, revealing profound modifications to the Periapsis Shift profile, including prograde-to-retrograde transitions and radial dependencies. Our results demonstrate that the Periapsis Shift--not merely its magnitude but its qualitative orbital behavior--allows a meaningful experimental probe for the WGC in strong-field regimes."}

However, since this method is calibrated using reverberation-mapped AGNs, its validity across the entire AGN population remains uncertain. We aim to examine the breathing effect-the variability of emission line widths with continuum luminosity-beyond reverberation-mapped AGNs, to assess the validity and estimate potential systematic uncertainties of single-epoch virial black hole mass estimates. We construct an unprecedentedly large multi-epoch spectroscopic dataset of quasars from SDSS DR16, focusing on four key broad emission lines (Ha, Hb, MgII, and CIV). We assess how breathing behavior evolves with the rest-frame time interval between observations. We detect no significant breathing signal in Ha, Hb, or MgII at any observed timescale. In contrast, CIV exhibits a statistically significant anti-breathing trend, most prominent at intermediate timescales. Notably, for Hb, which has shown breathing in previous reverberation-mapped samples, we recover the effect only in the small subset of quasars with clearly detected BLR lags and only during the epochs when such lags are measurable-suggesting that both the lag and breathing signals are intermittent, possibly due to a weak correlation between optical and ionizing continua. These results highlight the complex, variable, and timescale-dependent nature of line profile variability and underscore its implications for single-epoch black hole mass estimates."}

Lensing induces frequency-dependent amplification of GWs, which can be computed using \\texttt{GLoW}, an accurate code suitable for evaluating this factor for generic lens models and arbitrary impact parameters depending on the lens configuration. For parameter inference, we employ the DINGO algorithm, a machine learning framework based on neural posterior estimation, a simulation-based inference method that uses normalizing flows to efficiently approximate posterior distributions of the physical parameters. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that it enables efficient parameter estimation of diffracted GW signals using an isolated point mass lens model. This method can be useful for rapidly identifying microlensed events within large GW catalogs and for conducting population studies of compact binaries. Compared to traditional parameter estimation techniques, we find that combining DINGO with importance sampling can provide efficient estimation of the background Bayes-factor distribution, which is required in evaluating the significance of candidate lensed events. However, for foreground (lensed) events, care must be taken, as sampling efficiency can decrease when the lensed data lie outside the distribution learned by the unlensed DINGO network. Our framework can be naturally extended to more complex and realistic lens models, allowing detailed analyses of the microlensed GWs."}

We show that neutrino and HDM wakes are unlikely to be ever observed with the most natural tracer of a hot subcomponent of the total dark matter on cosmological scales, i.e. 2D weak lensing surveys.

We test the Generalised Scale Factor (GEN) evolution and benchmark it against three time-evolving dark energy models; namely Chevallier Polarski Linder (CPL), Jassal Bagla Padmanabhan (JBP) and Logarithmic (LOG) parametrizations; comparing their sensitivity to these systematic effects. Calibration biases and progenitor evolution emerge as the dominant sources of uncertainty, while simpler parametrisations, viz. GEN, which directly describes the expansion rate, remains relatively stable under all systematic injections, unlike CPL, JBP and LOG that rely on the dark energy equation of state.

The presence of massive objects breaks homogeneity and isotropy, allowing for new interactions between different GW polarizations, and opening up the intriguing opportunity to test modified gravity theories. This setup generalizes the notion of gravitational deflection and lensing, revealing novel phenomena in modified theories. Any non-minimal theory introduces effective mass terms for GWs, causing \\textit{lens-induced dispersion} (LID), a frequency-dependent phase shift on the waveform. We compute GW dispersion in Einstein's general relativity (GR) for a spherical matter distribution, finding a small but non-zero phasing that is potentially accessible to next-generation detectors. We then extend our analysis to scalar-tensor theories, focusing on symmetron gravity as an example of screened theory, combining cosmological deviations and consistency with local gravity tests. We find enhanced GW dispersion in a large region of the symmetron parameter space, compared to both GR and Brans-Dicke theory. We argue that dispersion, associated to an effective mass for the metric fluctuations, can in some cases prevent the propagation of GWs through some astrophysical bodies, turning them into reflectors. Our analysis shows that the Earth becomes an efficient GW shield for a hitherto unconstrained region of the symmetron parameter space, leading to a $\\sim 50\\%$ fraction of events becoming unobservable or at least displaying a dramatic modification of the detector antenna response. The richness and universality of dispersive phenomena in non-minimal theories open a new avenue to test theories of dynamical dark-energy, relevant in light of recent observational results challenging the $Λ$CDM paradigm."}

Using resolved galaxy samples from the largest simulation volume of IllustrisTNG (TNG300-1), we examine how galaxy properties vary as a function of distance to the closest cluster. We train neural networks to classify galaxies into cluster and field galaxies based on their intrinsic properties. Using this classifier, we present the first quantitative and probabilistic map of the transition region. It is represented as a broad and intrinsically scattered region near cluster outskirts, rather than a sharp physical boundary. This is the physical detection of a mixed population. In order to determine transition regions of different physical processes by training property-specific models, we categorise galaxy properties based on their underlying physics, i.e. gas, stellar, and dynamical. Changes to the dynamical properties dominate the innermost regions of the clusters of all masses. Stellar properties and gas properties, on the other hand, exhibit transitions at similar locations for low mass clusters, yet gas properties have transitions in the outermost regions for high mass clusters.

In this work, we perform a systematic comparison of fluxes derived from three approaches: the quadrupole formula, post-Newtonian approximations, and time-domain solutions of the Teukolsky equation. We show that quadrupole-based fluxes remain in good agreement with Teukolsky results across a broad range of orbital configurations, including perturbed orbits. Building on these insights, we explore the dynamical impact of resonance crossings within the adiabatic approximation.

The analysis of the mean spectra reveals that the Balmer decrement shows no correlation with AGN luminosity, while it is inversely correlated with the Eddington ratio. However, the temporal variation of the Balmer decrement in individual objects exhibits an even stronger anti-correlation with AGN luminosity, suggesting that the change in AGN luminosity plays a dominant role in determining the Balmer decrement. By comparing the temporal evolution of the Balmer decrement with the continuum color, we find that reddening due to the AGN itself may not be the primary factor. Instead, radiative transfer effects and excitation mechanisms, which deviate from the Case B recombination, appear to be critical for the variation of the Balmer decrement. These results provide useful insights into the underlying physics of changing-look AGNs and high-$z$ AGNs, such as the ``little red dots'', which exhibit extreme values of the Balmer decrement that can be misinterpreted as evidence for dust."}

They serve as a powerful tool for probing inner structures of AGNs and estimating the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The delays exhibit a strong correlation with approximately the square root of the optical luminosity - a relationship known as the \"standard structure\" of AGN broad-line regions (BLRs). Here, we report the discovery of leading delays in Hβ line reverberations (LDRs) in the quasar PHL 1092 preceding variations of the 5100 Å continuum by 17-57 days, based on our eight-year continuous campaign of reverberation mapping of super Eddington AGNs. The LDRs suggest that the 5100 Å continuum regions are so extensive that they are larger than the BLRs. This phenomenon not only fundamentally disrupts the well-established BLR size-luminosity relation but also violates the principle of causality. This unprecedented LDRs challenge the conventional methods for estimating SMBH mass as well as the standard model of AGNs. A preferred scenario to explain the LDRs is that the SMBH-disk contains a population of accreting stellar-mass black holes (sMBHs) as extra heating sources of the disk. Consequently, continuum regions of the disk are efficiently stretched so that the 5100 Å regions exceed the BLRs, yielding the observed LDRs. Generally, sMBH activities there could provide new physics of AGN phenomena, which can be tested by LIGO, LISA/Tianqin and ET detections of gravitational waves from sMBH mergers."}

By adding a rotating disk component to the biconical outflow model of Bae & Woo, we find that models with a rotating disk require faster launching velocities ($\\lesssim$ 1500 km s$^{-1}$) than outflow-only models to be consistent with the observed gas kinematics of local type 2 AGNs. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to reproduce the observed distribution of gas kinematics of a large sample ($\\sim$ 39,000), constraining the launching velocity and opening angle. While the launching velocity is moderate for the majority of the local AGNs, the notable cases of 2 - 5 % show strong outflows with $V_{max} \\sim 1000-1500$ km s$^{-1}$. By examining the seeing effect based on the mock integral field unit data, we find that the outflow sizes measured based on velocity widths tend to be overestimated when the angular size of the outflow is comparable to or smaller than the seeing. This result highlights the need for more careful treatments of the seeing effect in the outflow size measurement, yet it still supports the lack of global feedback by gas outflows for local AGNs."}

The presence of massive objects breaks homogeneity and isotropy, allowing for new interactions between different GW polarizations, and opening up the intriguing opportunity to test modified gravity theories. This setup generalizes the notion of gravitational deflection and lensing, revealing novel phenomena in modified theories. Any non-minimal theory introduces effective mass terms for GWs, causing \\textit{lens-induced dispersion} (LID), a frequency-dependent phase shift on the waveform. We compute GW dispersion in Einstein's general relativity (GR) for a spherical matter distribution, finding a small but non-zero phasing that is potentially accessible to next-generation detectors. We then extend our analysis to scalar-tensor theories, focusing on symmetron gravity as an example of screened theory, combining cosmological deviations and consistency with local gravity tests. We find enhanced GW dispersion in a large region of the symmetron parameter space, compared to both GR and Brans-Dicke theory. We argue that dispersion, associated to an effective mass for the metric fluctuations, can in some cases prevent the propagation of GWs through some astrophysical bodies, turning them into reflectors. Our analysis shows that the Earth becomes an efficient GW shield for a hitherto unconstrained region of the symmetron parameter space, leading to a $\\sim 50\\%$ fraction of events becoming unobservable or at least displaying a dramatic modification of the detector antenna response. The richness and universality of dispersive phenomena in non-minimal theories open a new avenue to test theories of dynamical dark-energy, relevant in light of recent observational results challenging the $Λ$CDM paradigm."}

The results showed that the location within the Milky Way may influence localized triggered star formation within individual regions. There is strong evidence that there are fewer older stars (Transition Disks) within the Outer regions of the Galaxy (2.91 +- 1.74%), accompanied by a higher number of Class I (32.49 +- 10.77%). This is different from the Inner Galactic regions where the Transition Disks are higher (32.93 +- 13.78%) as compared to low Class I sources (11.01 +- 4.81%).

We improve on previous inferences on DM properties from lensed quasars by simultaneously reconstructing extended lensed arcs with image positions and relative magnifications (flux ratios). Our forward modeling framework generates full populations of subhalos, line-of-sight halos, and globular clusters, uses an accurate model for subhalo tidal evolution, and accounts for free-streaming effects on halo abundance and concentration. Modeling lensed arcs leads to more-precise model-predicted flux ratios, breaking covariance between subhalo abundance and the free-streaming scale parameterized by the half-mode mass $m_{\\rm{hm}}$.

By combining inferences for the binary component masses and luminosity distances from individual observations, it is possible to infer $H_0$ without direct electromagnetic counterparts or galaxy catalogs. However, this relies on theoretical gravitational-wave models, which are known to be incomplete descriptions of the full predictions of general relativity. Although the accuracy of our models are improving, they are also becoming increasingly expensive as additional phenomena are incorporated. In this work, we demonstrate that there is no significant advantage in including spin-precession and higher-order multipole moments when inferring $H_0$ via the mass spectrum method for current and near-future gravitational-wave event numbers. Even when simulating a population of highly precessing and preferentially asymmetric-mass-ratio binaries, we show that the inferred $H_0$ posterior changes minimally. Using a simpler, less accurate model, achieves comparable $H_0$ estimates with six times less computational cost (on average). Using computationally cheaper models for single event inference may become crucial as thousands of gravitational-wave observations are expected to be detected in the near future."}

The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) will revolutionize this field by discovering up to $\\sim$100,000 galaxy-scale strong lenses, a huge increase over current samples. To harness the statistical power of this vast dataset, we forecast its cosmological constraining power using the gravitational-dynamical mass combination method. We create a realistic simulated lens sample and test how uncertainties in redshift and velocity dispersion measurements affect results under ideal, optimistic, and pessimistic scenarios. We find that increasing the sample size from 100 to 10,000 systems dramatically improves precision: in the $Λ$CDM model, the uncertainty on the matter density parameter, $Ω_m$, drops from 0.2 to 0.01; in the $w$CDM model, the uncertainty on the dark energy equation of state, $w$, decreases from 0.3 to 0.04. With 10,000 lenses, our constraints on dark energy are twice as tight as those from the latest DESI BAO measurements. We also compare two parameter estimation techniques -- MultiNest sampling and Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling (BHM). While both achieve similar precision, BHM provides more robust estimates of intrinsic lens parameters, whereas MultiNest is about twice as fast. This work establishes an efficient and scalable framework for cosmological analysis with next-generation strong lensing surveys."}

Lensing induces frequency-dependent amplification of GWs, which can be computed using \\texttt{GLoW}, an accurate code suitable for evaluating this factor for generic lens models and arbitrary impact parameters depending on the lens configuration. For parameter inference, we employ the DINGO algorithm, a machine learning framework based on neural posterior estimation, a simulation-based inference method that uses normalizing flows to efficiently approximate posterior distributions of the physical parameters. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that it enables efficient parameter estimation of diffracted GW signals using an isolated point mass lens model. This method can be useful for rapidly identifying microlensed events within large GW catalogs and for conducting population studies of compact binaries. Compared to traditional parameter estimation techniques, we find that combining DINGO with importance sampling can provide efficient estimation of the background Bayes-factor distribution, which is required in evaluating the significance of candidate lensed events. However, for foreground (lensed) events, care must be taken, as sampling efficiency can decrease when the lensed data lie outside the distribution learned by the unlensed DINGO network. Our framework can be naturally extended to more complex and realistic lens models, allowing detailed analyses of the microlensed GWs."}

Their detection will measure the astrophysical properties of the MBH in the center of our galaxy (SgrA$^\\ast$) with unprecedented accuracy and provide a unique probe of gravity in the strong field regime. Here, we estimate the benefit of using the GWs from XMRIs to constrain the Chern-Simons theory. Our results show that XMRI signals radiated from the late stages of the evolution are particularly sensitive to differences between Chern-Simons theory and general relativity. For low-eccentricity sources, XMRIs can put bounds on the Chern-Simons parameter $ζ$ at the level of $10^{-1}$ to an accuracy of $10^{-3}$. For high-eccentricity sources, XMRIs can put bounds on the parameter $ζ$ at the level of $10^{-1}$ to an accuracy of $10^{-6}$. Furthermore, using the time-frequency MCMC method, we obtain the posterior distribution of XMRIs in the Chern-Simons theory. Our results show that almost all the parameters can be recovered within $1σ$ confidence interval. For most of the intrinsic parameters, the estimation accuracy reaches $10^{-3}$. For the brown dwarf mass, the estimation accuracy reaches $10^{-1}$, while for $ζ$, the estimation accuracy reaches $Δ\\log_{10}ζ=0.08$ for high eccentricity sources and 1.27 for low eccentricity sources."}

Comments are Welcome", "summary": "We investigate the impact of instrumental and astrophysical systematics on dark energy constraints derived from Type~Ia supernova (SN-Ia) observations. Using simulated datasets consistent with current SN-Ia measurements, we explore how uncertainties in photometric calibration, intergalactic dust, progenitor evolution in luminosity and light-curve stretch, and intrinsic color scatter affect the inferred dark energy equation of state parameters (w0, wa). We test the Generalised Scale Factor (GEN) evolution and benchmark it against three time-evolving dark energy models; namely Chevallier Polarski Linder (CPL), Jassal Bagla Padmanabhan (JBP) and Logarithmic (LOG) parametrizations; comparing their sensitivity to these systematic effects. Calibration biases and progenitor evolution emerge as the dominant sources of uncertainty, while simpler parametrisations, viz. GEN, which directly describes the expansion rate, remains relatively stable under all systematic injections, unlike CPL, JBP and LOG that rely on the dark energy equation of state. These findings underscore the need for sub-per cent calibration precision and enhanced astrophysical modelling to ensure the robustness of dark energy inferences from current and future SN-Ia cosmology experiments."}
