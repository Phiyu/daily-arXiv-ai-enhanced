Using a convolutional neural network\n(V-Net) trained on A-SIM simulation data, our approach reconstructs density or\npotential fields from galaxy positions and radial peculiar velocities. The full\n3D peculiar velocity field is then derived from the reconstructed potential. We\nvalidate the method with mocks that mimic the spatial distribution of the\nCosmicflows-4 (CF4) catalog and apply it to actual data. Given CF4's\nsignificant observational uncertainties and since our model does not yet\naccount for them, we use peculiar velocities corrected via an existing\nHamiltonian Monte Carlo reconstruction, rather than raw catalog distances. Our\nresults demonstrate that the reconstructed density field recovers known galaxy\nclusters detected in an H \\textsc{i} survey of the ZOA, despite this dataset\nnot being used in the reconstruction. This agreement underscores the potential\nof our method to reveal structures in data-sparse regions. Most notably,\nstreamline convergence and watershed analysis identify a mass concentration\nconsistent with the Great Attractor, at $(l, b) = (308.4^\\circ \\pm 2.4^\\circ,\n29.0^\\circ \\pm 1.9^\\circ)$ and $cz = 4960.1 \\pm 404.4,{\\rm km/s}$, for 64\\% of\nrealizations.

We show that simple nearest-neighbour based estimates can provide\nmore accurate photo-$z$s than template fitting out to $z\\sim8$, as well as\nreducing the fraction of catastrophic outliers by a factor of $\\sim2-3$.\nAdditionally, `hybrid' estimates combining template and ML can yield further\nimprovements in overall accuracy and reliability while retaining some ability\nto predict photo-$z$ out to $z > 10$. The nearest-neighbour only or hybrid\nestimates can achieve photo-$z$s with robust scatter of\n$\\sigma_{\\text{NMAD}}\\sim0.03-0.04$ and outlier fractions of $\\sim3-10\\%$\nbetween $0 < z \\lesssim 8$ from just 6 NIRCam bands, with negligible additional\ncomputational costs compared to standard template fitting. Our methodology is\neasily adaptable to alternative datasets, filter combinations or training\nsamples. Overall, our results highlight the potential for even simple ML\ntechniques to enhance the scientific return of JWST pure parallel and wide-area\nsurveys."}

This phantom\ncrossing is a key feature that cannot be achieved by minimally coupled scalar\nfields (quintessence) within GR. This suggests the need for a new degree of\nfreedom that can simultaneously: (A) increase the best-fit value of $H_0$ in\nthe context of the DESI DR2 data, and (B) allow the crossing of the $w=-1$ line\nwithin a new theoretical approach. We argue that both of these goals may be\nachieved in the context of Modified Gravity (MG), and in particular,\nScalar-Tensor (ST) theories, where phantom crossing is a natural and viable\nfeature.

This work presents the first simulation-based inference (SBI)\npipeline that combines weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps in a realistic\nDark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) configuration and serves as preparation for\na forthcoming analysis of the survey data. We develop a scalable forward model\nbased on the CosmoGridV1 suite of N-body simulations to generate over one\nmillion self-consistent mock realizations of DES Y3 at the map level.\nLeveraging this large dataset, we train deep graph convolutional neural\nnetworks on the full survey footprint in spherical geometry to learn\nlow-dimensional features that approximately maximize mutual information with\ntarget parameters. These learned compressions enable neural density estimation\nof the implicit likelihood via normalizing flows in a ten-dimensional parameter\nspace spanning cosmological $w$CDM, intrinsic alignment, and linear galaxy bias\nparameters, while marginalizing over baryonic, photometric redshift, and shear\nbias nuisances. To ensure robustness, we extensively validate our inference\npipeline using synthetic observations derived from both systematic\ncontaminations in our forward model and independent Buzzard galaxy catalogs.\nOur forecasts yield significant improvements in cosmological parameter\nconstraints, achieving $2-3\\times$ higher figures of merit in the $\\Omega_m -\nS_8$ plane relative to our implementation of baseline two-point statistics and\neffectively breaking parameter degeneracies through probe combination. These\nresults demonstrate the potential of SBI analyses powered by deep learning for\nupcoming Stage-IV wide-field imaging surveys."}

APOGEE radial velocities,\nstellar parameters, and Gaia EDR3 proper motions are used to identify member\nstars in the vicinity of each dwarf. To properly analyze the abundance patterns\nof these galaxies, a novel procedure was developed to determine the measurable\nupper limits of the APOGEE chemical abundances as a function of the effective\ntemperature and the spectral signal-to-noise ratio. In general, the APOGEE\nabundance patterns of these galaxies (limited to [Fe/H] $>$ -2.5) agree with\nthose found in high-resolution optical studies after abundance offsets are\napplied. Most of the galaxies studied have abundance patterns that are\ndistinctly different from the majority of stars found in the MW halo,\nsuggesting that these galaxies contributed little to the MW halo above [Fe/H]\n$>$ -2.0. From these abundance patterns, we find that these dSphs tend to\nfollow two types of chemical evolution paths: episodic and continuous star\nformation, a result that is consistent with previous photometric studies of\ntheir star formation histories. We explore whether mass and/or environment have\nan impact on whether a galaxy has an episodic or continuous star formation\nhistory, finding evidence that, in addition to the galaxy's mass, proximity to\na larger galaxy and the cessation of star formation may drive the overall shape\nof the chemical evolution."}

Using the pseudospectral code\nbamps with a new adapted symmetry reduction method, which we call $m$-cartoon,\nand a generalized twist-compatible apparent horizon finder, we evolve\nnear-critical initial data to the verge of black hole formation for the lowest\nnontrivial modes, $m=1$ and $m=2$. For $m=1$ we recover discrete\nself-similarity with echoing period $\\Delta\\simeq0.42$ and power-law scaling\nwith exponent $\\gamma\\simeq0.11$, consistent with earlier work. For $m=2$ we\nfind that universality is maintained within this nonzero fixed-$m$ symmetry\nclass but with smaller period and critical exponents, $\\Delta\\simeq0.09$ and\n$\\gamma\\simeq0.035$, establishing an explicit dependence of the critical\nsolution on the angular mode. Analysis of the relation between the angular\nmomentum and the mass of apparent horizons at the instant of formation,\n$J_{\\mathrm{AH}}{-}M_{\\mathrm{AH}}$, shows that the effect of angular momentum\nis minimal at the threshold, with\n$\\chi_{\\mathrm{AH}}=J_{\\mathrm{AH}}/M_{\\mathrm{AH}}^2\\to0$, and, therefore,\nexcludes extremal black holes for the families under consideration. Our results\ndemonstrate that while universality and DSS hold within each $m$-sector, the\ncritical universal values vary with $m$, and neither extremality nor\nbifurcation occur in the complex scalar field model within the families\nconsidered here."}

Thus, we consider the relativistic Bondi accretion beyond a\nsimplified perfect-fluid setup. We focus on the complex scalar field with\ncanonical kinetic term and with a generic quartic potential which either\npreserves the U(1) symmetry or exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is\nwell known that in the lowest order in gradient expansion the dynamics of such\na scalar field is well approximated by a perfect superfluid; we demonstrate\nthat going beyond this approximation systematically reduces the accretion rate\nwith respect to the perfect fluid case.

If the EP\nis violated, different tracers will undergo different accelerations in response\nto a uniform gravitational field, and this loss of universality manifests as a\ndipole with a characteristic $1/K$ scale dependence in the squeezed limit of\nthe bispectrum. In this work we show that such a violation can be identified\nwith a particular anti-symmetric {modulation} in the local cross-power spectrum\nof distinct tracers. Based on this observation, we propose to test the EP using\nquadratic estimators as a more practical alternative to the conventional\napproach of directly estimating the bispectrum. We apply our quadratic\nestimator to a DESI-like survey and forecast constraints on the overall\namplitude of EP violation. Including mildly nonlinear scales in our\nreconstruction ($k_\\mathrm{max}\\simeq0.15\\, h\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), we find\nthat our estimator is competitive with the more exhaustive direct bispectrum\napproach. This means surveys like DESI can already benefit from the quadratic\nestimator approach."}

Hubble tension, the cosmological constant and aperiodic filaments", "comment": "8 pages; A&A (in press)", "summary": "The appearance and specific properties of the structures in the local\nUniverse are studied by means of the Vlasov kinetic technique. The role of the\ncosmological constant in the local structure formation is considered via the\ntheorem on the general function satisfying the identity of the gravity of\nsphere and of point mass. Then, the Hubble tension is naturally explained as a\nresult of two flows, local and global one, with non-coinciding Hubble\nparameters. The linearized Vlasov-Poisson equation with the cosmological term\nis shown to lead to van Kampen's waves, of Landau damping and then to aperiodic\nstructures. The aperiodicity thus is emerging as a intrinsic feature of the\nfilamentary and void structure of the local Universe, revealing the\nself-consistent field mechanism of its formation. The damping of the\naperiodicity then is predicted and can be observationally traced upon the\nincrease of the scale of the filaments."}

When a primordial black hole accretes at a high accretion rate, it\nemits a large number of high-energy photons. These heat the plasma, causing\nhigh-redshift cosmological 21cm line emission. Since this has not been\ndetected, there is a strict upper bound on the accretion rate.

When analyzed in the context of General\nRelativity (GR), the latest DESI data favor a dynamical dark energy (DDE)\nequation of state, $w(z)$, that crosses the phantom divide line $w=-1$.\nHowever, this framework prefers a lower Hubble constant, $H_0$, than Planck\n2018, thereby worsening the tension with local measurements. This phantom\ncrossing is a key feature that cannot be achieved by minimally coupled scalar\nfields (quintessence) within GR. This suggests the need for a new degree of\nfreedom that can simultaneously: (A) increase the best-fit value of $H_0$ in\nthe context of the DESI DR2 data, and (B) allow the crossing of the $w=-1$ line\nwithin a new theoretical approach. We argue that both of these goals may be\nachieved in the context of Modified Gravity (MG), and in particular,\nScalar-Tensor (ST) theories, where phantom crossing is a natural and viable\nfeature. We demonstrate these facts by analyzing a joint dataset including DESI\nDR2, Pantheon+, CMB, and growth-rate (RSD) data in the context of simple\nparametrizations for the effective gravitational constant, $\\mu_G(z) \\equiv\nG_{eff}/G_N$, and the DDE equation of state, $w(z)$. This MG framework\nsignificantly alleviates the tension, leading to a higher inferred value of\n$H_0 = 70.6 \\pm 1.7 \\, \\text{km s}^{-1} \\text{Mpc}^{-1}$. We also present a\nsystematic, data-driven reconstruction of the required underlying ST Lagrangian\nand provide simple, generic analytical expressions for both the non-minimal\ncoupling $F(\\Phi) = 1+\\xi\\Phi^{2}e^{n\\Phi}$ and the scalar potential $U(\\Phi) =\nU_{0}+ae^{b\\Phi^{2}}$, which well-describe the reconstructed functions."}
