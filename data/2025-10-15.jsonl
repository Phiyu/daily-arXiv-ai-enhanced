We aim to evaluate the impact of self-gravitating effects on the\nevolution of vertical phase spirals and to quantify the bias introduced in\nestimating their excitation time when such effects are ignored. We analysed a\nhigh-resolution, self-consistent $N$-body simulation of the MW-Sagittarius\ndwarf galaxy (Sgr) system, alongside four test particle simulations in\npotentials contracted from the $N$-body snapshots. In each case, we estimated\nthe winding time of phase spirals by measuring the slope of the density\ncontrast in the vertical angle-frequency space. In test particle models, the\nphase spiral begins winding immediately after Sgr's pericentre passage, and the\nwinding time closely tracks the true elapsed time since the Sgr's pericentre\npassage. Adding the DM wake yields only a modest (< 100 Myr) reduction of the\nwinding time relative to Sgr alone. By contrast, the self-consistent $N$-body\nsimulation exhibits an initial, coherent vertical oscillation lasting $\\gtrsim$\n300 Myr before a clear spiral forms, leading to systematic underestimation of\nexcitation times. An analytical shearing-box model with self-gravity, developed\nby Widrow (2023), qualitatively reproduces this delay, supporting its origin in\nthe disc's self-gravitating response. Assuming that self-gravity affects phase\nmixing in the MW to the same degree as the $N$-body model, the lag induced by\nself-gravity is estimated to be $\\sim$ 0.3 Gyr in the solar neighbourhood.\nAccounting for this delay revises the inferred age of the MW's observed phase\nspiral to $\\sim$0.6-1.2 Gyr, in better agreement with the Sgr's pericentre\npassage.

These findings support a scenario in which cold gas flows via\nfilaments and to the core, fed by the cold-stream mode accretion in the early\nphase of protocluster assembly, and promoting active star formation there.\nFurther evidence of the scenario comes from the alignment of massive, evolved\ngalaxies in those filaments traced by distant red galaxies, suggesting\naccelerated galaxy growth in the filaments in the early Universe. This study\nclearly shows observationally that accelerated galaxy formation takes place not\nonly in the protocluster core but also in the associated surrounding\nfilamentary structure.

We present the pilot\nof a larger multi-wavelength study searching for and quantifying\nstellar-feedback-driven winds and outflows on both spatially and globally\nresolved scales for a sample of 40 nearby low-mass galaxies. We search for\noutflow signatures in the star-forming dwarf galaxy NGC 3741 using new optical\nimaging and spectroscopy from the WIYN 3.5m telescope in conjunction with VLA\n21cm observations and local star formation histories derived from resolved HST\nphotometry. With this extensive dataset, we compare the neutral and ionized gas\nmorphologies and kinematics, calculate mass-loading factors, and investigate\nspatial variations in the star formation history of NGC 3741. Though the galaxy\nis experiencing a burst in star formation, we find little evidence of strong\noutflows and calculate very low mass-loading factors. We suggest that, though\nstar formation activity has increased dramatically in the central region of the\ngalaxy over the last 40 Myr, the star formation rate is not high enough to\nproduce a sufficient amount of high mass stars responsible for fueling\noutflows. Future analysis of the larger sample will allow us to explore how\nstellar feedback impacts mass loss on local scales, providing a deeper\nunderstanding of the interplay between stellar feedback and the interstellar\nmedium in low-mass galaxies."}

Previous studies of AGN in\nsimulations have mainly focused on major interactions (i.e. between\napproximately equal mass galaxies), which produce the strongest inflows and,\ntherefore, would be the most likely to trigger AGN activity. However, minor\ninteractions are far more common and may still enhance accretion onto\nsupermassive black holes. We present an analysis of post-merger galaxies from\nthe IllustrisTNG simulation with stellar mass ratios of $\\mu>$1:100. We select\npost-mergers from the TNG50-1 simulation, from redshifts $0\\leq z< 1$, with\nstellar masses greater than $10^{10}M_{\\odot}$. We find an AGN excess in\npost-mergers with a stellar mass ratio as low as 1:40. The AGN excess is mass\nratio and luminosity dependent, with 1.2-1.6 times more AGN found in\npost-mergers of 1:40$\\leq \\mu < $1:4 than in matched non-merger controls, and\nas many as 6 times more AGN found in major $\\mu \\geq$1:4 post-mergers. The AGN\nexcess is long lived, between 500 Myr to 1 Gyr post-coalescence, across all of\nthe mass ratio regimes. We demonstrate that the most luminous AGN in the\nsimulation overwhelmingly occur in either post-mergers or pairs (with $\\mu \\geq\n$1:40). Finally, we demonstrate that mini mergers are likely to be overlooked\nin observational studies due to the weakness of features usually associated\nwith recent merger activity, such as tidal streams and shells, making it\nchallenging to completely account for merger-induced AGN activity even in deep\ngalaxy surveys."}

By\ncombining SDSS and DESI Legacy Survey (DLS) images, we classified galaxies into\n13 Hubble types, detected tidal features, categorized bars into different\nfamilies, and estimated concentration, asymmetry, and clumpiness. The depth of\nthe DLS images allowed us to identify structural details that were not evident\nin the SDSS images, resulting in a more reliable classification. After\ncorrecting for volume completeness, we find a bimodal distribution in galaxy\nmorphology, with peaks in S0 and Scd types, and a transition zone around S0a-Sa\ntypes. Bars are present in 54% of disc galaxies with inclinations < 70,\nfollowing a bimodal trend with peaks in Sab-Sb and Scd-Sd types. Tidal\nstructures are identified in ~13% of galaxies, particularly in massive E-Sa and\nlow-mass Sdm-Irr galaxies. We derive the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF)\nand decompose it into each morphological type. Schechter functions accurately\ndescribe the latter, while a triple Schechter function describes the total\nGSMF, associating three characteristic masses with different galaxy types. The\nabundance of early-type galaxies remains constant at low masses; they are\npredominantly satellites. We confirm that later-type galaxies are generally\nyounger, bluer, more star-forming, and less metal-rich compared to early-type\ngalaxies. Additionally, we find evidence connecting morphology and stellar mass\nto the star formation history of galaxies. The MVM catalogue provides a robust\ndataset for investigating galaxy evolution, secular processes, and machine\nlearning-based morphological classifications."}

However, the confirmed detection\nof such a unique astrophysical phenomenon is challenging due to several sources\nof contamination, arising from detector noise to astrophysical uncertainties.\nRobust model-independent search techniques that can mitigate noise\ncontamination were developed in the past. In this study, we explore the\nastrophysical uncertainty associated with incorrectly classifying a pair of\nunlensed GW events as a lensed event, and the associated False Alarm Rate (FAR)\ndepending on the GW source properties. To understand the effect of unlensed\nastrophysical GW sources in producing false lensing detections, we have\nperformed a model-independent test using the pipeline GLANCE on a simulated\npopulation of merging binary-black holes (BBHs). We find that $\\sim$ 0.01\\% of\nthe event pairs can be falsely classified as lensed with a lensing threshold\nsignal-to-noise ratio of 1.5, appearing at a time delay between the event pairs\nof $\\sim$ 1000 days or more. We show the FAR distribution for the parameter\nspace of GW source masses, delay time, and lensing magnification parameter over\nwhich the model-independent technique GLANCE can confidently detect lensed GW\npair with the current LIGO detector sensitivity. In the future, this technique\nwill be useful for understanding the FAR of the upcoming next-generation GW\ndetectors, which can observe many more GW sources."}

We develop a comprehensive forward model based on the AbacusSummit\ncosmological simulations: mock galaxy group catalogues and synthetic kSZ maps\nare generated, together with a reconstructed peculiar velocity field that\nallows for photo-$z$ errors, redshift-space distortions, and survey masks. We\ninvestigate possible contamination from the cosmic infrared background (CIB),\nfinding that CIB effects are subdominant to the kSZ signal in the relevant ACT\nfrequency channel. We then predict the kSZ signal expected when stacking CMB\ntemperature maps around groups, taking account of their estimated radial\nvelocity. Comparing the model with observations, we are able to constrain the\ntotal baryon fraction within haloes, as well as their internal gas profiles. We\nfind evidence for mass dependence of the halo baryon fraction within the virial\nradius.The gas fraction in massive groups is consistent with the universal\nbaryon fraction, but low-mass groups ($10^{12.5} \\lesssim\nM\\,/h^{-1}\\mathrm{M}_\\odot \\lesssim 10^{14}$) are depleted to $0.21 \\pm 0.06$\ntimes the universal baryon fraction. We find this low virial baryon fraction to\nbe consistent with an extended gas profile, for which the total baryon content\nreaches the universal value well beyond the virial radius. This conclusion is\nconsistent with previous analyses using X-ray, kSZ, and weak lensing, and\nplausibly reflects energetic feedback processes from the galaxies in these\nhaloes."}
