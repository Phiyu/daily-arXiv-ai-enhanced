This\nhas a substantial impact on the topology of reionization and thus the prospects\nof tomography of the 21-cm signal from upcoming radio interferometers. In this\nwork we develop the first analytic model of reionization which explicitly\nincorporates the MFP as a free parameter, allowing us to transparently explore\nits effect on the process. Our model is based on the excursion set formalism\nwith an ionization condition which accounts for absorptions parameterized\nthrough the MFP. With the goal of observational comparison, we include\nadditional modifications which make our model particularly suitable for\npredicting one-point statistics of the ionization field (and 21-cm signal),\nwhich are among the fundamental quantities for tomography. We find that the\neffect of the MFP is much more significant during the later stages of\nreionization, and that including a shorter MFP reduces the size of HII regions\nby around an order of magnitude towards the end of reionization compared with\nanalytic models which do not account for the MFP. We find that the reported MFP\nvalue produces a contrast in the 21-cm signal of $\\mathcal{O}$(1 mK) or less at\nresolutions $\\theta \\sim $ 15--35 arcmin, an order of magnitude below naive\nestimates and up to a factor of several smaller than when using a larger MFP\nvalue extrapolated from low $z$, requiring significantly more sensitivity for\nimaging. We compare the contrast to noise estimates for arrays similar in size\nto HERA and SKA-Low and find that SKA has sufficient sensitivity for direct\nimaging (at the largest scales considered), while the predicted signal will be\nchallenging for arrays similar in size to HERA. Our model indicates that more\ndetailed sensitivity estimates are warranted in the context of a short MFP."}

The memory is most\naffected by changes in the equation of state, the binary mass, and the magnetic\nfield. In particular, for moderate premerger field strengths, the dominant\nimpact of the electromagnetic field is the change in the gravitational wave\nluminosity, and the associated gravitational wave null memory, due to the\nunstable growth of the magnetic field and the resulting redistribution of\nangular momentum it induces in the remnant. While the direct electromagnetic\ncontribution to the null memory is additive, the change in the gravitational\nwave null memory can--in some cases--result in the total memory being smaller\nthan that from the corresponding nonmagnetized binary. Furthermore, in contrast\nto binary black hole mergers, the growth of the memory in binary neutron star\nmergers is extended due to the long emission timescale of electromagnetic\nfields, neutrinos, and ejecta.

This paper\nuses Cycle 1 MIR imaging from JWST/MIRI and spectroscopy from JWST/MRS for 11\nlocal Seyfert galaxies, as part of the Galactic Activity, Torus and Outflow\nSurvey (GATOS). Three of the objects (NGC 3081, NGC 5728, and NGC 7172) exist\nin both datasets, allowing direct measurement of the line emission using the\nspectroscopy for these objects.

Further, the line contamination levels vary greatly between objects\n(from 5% to 30% in the F1000W filter), and across filters, so cannot be\ngeneralised across a sample and must be carefully treated for each object and\nband. We also test methods to estimate the line contamination when only MRS\nspectroscopy or MIRI imaging is available, using pre-JWST ancillary data.

Using DESI Legacy\nImaging Survey data, we find that approximately 61% of barred galaxies exhibit\npronounced dark gaps. We compare the location of dark gaps with resonance radii\nderived from the Tremaine-Weinberg method applied to MaNGA data for the same\ngalaxies. Our analysis shows that dark gaps do not preferentially form at\nspecific resonances. Instead, their locations correlate with $\\mathcal{R}$\n$\\equiv$ $R_{CR}/R_{Bar}$: slow bars tend to show shorter dark gap radii, while\nfast bars show longer ones. This trend reflects a tight relation between bar\nlength and dark gap radius. However, when barred galaxies are classified by\ntheir ring morphology, certain types exhibit dark gaps that align with specific\nresonances. Notably, dark gaps located between the inner and outer rings are\nclosely associated with the corotation radius. In galaxies with two dark gaps\nalong the bar minor axis profile, the inner dark gap typically aligns with the\nultraharmonic resonance, and the outer dark gap corresponds to the corotation\nradius. These findings suggest that some morphological types share similar\n$\\mathcal{R}$ values and exhibit dark gaps near specific resonances.

Our focus is the so-called `HI terminal\nvelocity curve' - a heliocentric measurement of the maximum Vlos as a function\nof Galactic longitude, which dates back to the early days of radio astronomy.\nIt is a powerful approach to indirectly estimating the gas dynamics because it\ndoes not require knowledge about the distance to individual gas clouds, which\nis difficult to estimate. A comparison of the terminal velocities and recovered\nrotation curve values in the simulations against observations suggests that our\nmodels are in need of further refinement. The gravitational torques associated\nwith our synthetic bars are too strong, driving excessive streaming motion in\nthe inner gas disc. This causes the simulated terminal velocity curves in the\nGalactic Quadrant I and IV to deviate substantially from each other, unlike\nwhat is seen in observed HI terminal velocities of the MW. We suggest possible\nways forward for future models."}

Our results revealed ubiquitous subsonic velocity\ndispersions of CH, in contrast to $^{13}$CO, which is predominantly supersonic.\nThe findings suggest that subsonic CH emissions may trace dense, low-turbulent\ngas structures in PGCCs. To investigate environmental effects, particularly the\ncosmic-ray ionization rate (CRIR), we estimated CRIR upper limits from HINSA,\nyielding values from $(8.1\\pm4.7)\\times10^{-18}$ to $(2.0\\pm0.8)\\times10^{-16}$\ns$^{-1}$ ($N_{H_2}$ from $(1.7\\pm0.2)\\times10^{21}$ to\n$(3.6\\pm0.4)\\times10^{22}$~cm$^{-2}$).

Using 33.6\nand 35.8 ks on-source in G235M and G395M, we observed a single mask with ~850\nsources, obtaining secure spectroscopic redshifts for ~540 galaxies over\n2.5<z<8.9. The per-configuration target density in DSS mode is 4-5x higher than\nstandard no- and low-overlap MSA strategies (<200 sources), with no loss in\nredshift precision or accuracy. Line-flux sensitivities are 30 percent lower at\nfixed exposure time, matching the expected increase in background noise, but\nthe gain in survey speed is 5x in our setup, more than justifying the penalty.\nThe measured line sensitivity exceeds NIRCam WFSS by a minimum factor of ~5\n(i.e. ~25 in exposure time) at $\\lambda$~4 $\\mu$m, demonstrating that\ncontrolled overlap is a compelling method to gain deep, wide-band spectra for\nlarge samples.

We derive Balmer-line based SFRs,\ngas-phase metallicities (including a large sample suitable for strong-line\ncalibrations), and identify rare sources (mini-quenched systems and broad-line\nAGN).

In this\nwork we develop the first analytic model of reionization which explicitly\nincorporates the MFP as a free parameter, allowing us to transparently explore\nits effect on the process.
