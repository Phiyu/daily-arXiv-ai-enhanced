But few such sources have been confirmed at z>4, making them a precious sample to examine what conditions result in such ordered kinematics in an early, more chaotic Universe. One of the best examples of this sample is the galaxy DLA0817g1 (z=4.2603), which shows remarkably clear rotation in ALMA [CII] data. We present recent JWST/NIRSpec IFU data (R~2700) of DLA0817g1, which we combine with archival ALMA [CII] observations to place constraints on its ISM conditions and morpho-kinematics. From a combination of line ratios, we find a high gas-phase metallicity (~0.7 solar), high fraction of obscured star formation, low ionisation (compared to other high-redshift galaxies observed with JWST), and no significant evidence for AGN (based on the WHAN diagnostic). Dynamical modelling with 3DBarolo reveal nearly identical rotation in Halpha and [CII], but with a higher velocity dispersion in the former. Using our metallicity estimate and previous CO and [CII] detections, we derive a new estimate of the molecular gas mass, relieving a previous strain in the mass budget. Altogether, we suggest that this is a 'smouldering' galaxy, where past star formation resulted in significant chemical enrichment (i.e., Zgas and Mdust), but the current activity is low (i.e., lower ionisation parameter and electron temperature). These new observations have opened a window into questions regarding the interplay of gas, metallicity, star formation, and kinematics in a prototypical early disk galaxy."}

Under this limit, the field equations yield the constraint $F(Q,T)H(t)=C$, implying that the function $F=f_Q$ becomes purely dependent on the nonmetricity scalar $Q$, and the background evolution mimics that of the standard $Λ$CDM model. We derive the resulting functional forms of $f(Q)$, obtain the corresponding effective cosmological constant, and analyze the physical nature of this reduction. To test the model against observations, we constrain the parameters $H_0$, $Ω_m$, and $S_8$ using cosmic chronometers (CC), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and Pantheon+ SN Ia datasets. A comparative analysis is performed using both the conventional Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and a machine-learning based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) emulator. We find that the ANN approach yields tighter posterior constraints while significantly reducing computational time. The model successfully reproduces the observational trends of each dataset and offers insights into the persistent $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. Our results indicate that effective nonmetricity-based dark energy scenarios derived from $f(Q,T)$ gravity provide a viable and observationally consistent alternative to $Λ$CDM, with future high-precision surveys expected to further distinguish between these frameworks."}

Although behaving as cold dark matter on cosmological scales, baryons annihilate with antimatter AQNs, producing ionizing high-energy photons. The resulting energy injection may imprint spectral distortions on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and modify the reionization history. Using a modified version of the \\texttt{CLASS} Boltzmann code we compute the impact of this energy injection on the $μ$ and $y$ spectral distortion parameters as well as on the optical depth. We find that (1) the CMB anisotropies remain essentially unaffected by baryon annihilation, and (2) the associated spectral distortion signatures lie within the sensitivity reach of proposed CMB spectral distortion missions.

First, we find that as the dark matter parameter $\\left|α\\right|$ increases, the fundamental characteristic quantities of the black hole, the event horizon $r_h$, the photon sphere radius $r_{ph}$, and the critical impact parameter $b_{ph}$ all increase, while the peak of the effective potential $V_{\\text{eff}}$ decreases and shifts toward the direction of increasing $r$. In contrast, the magnetic charge parameter $g$ suppresses $r_h$, $r_{ph}$, and $b_{ph}$, while increases the peak of $V_{\\text{eff}}$ and shifts it toward the direction of decreasing $r$. This indicates a competing effect between the dark matter parameter $\\left|α\\right|$ and the magnetic charge parameter $g$ on the fundamental properties of the black hole. Furthermore, we use the EHT observational data to constrain the dark matter parameters $α$ and find that the constraint range given by the supermassive black hole SgrA* is stricter than that of the black hole M87*. Finally, the black hole images are studied based on different accretion models, and it is found that both dark matter parameters $α$ and accretion models significantly influence the black hole images. For larger dark matter parameters $\\left|α\\right|$, the inner shadow or central faint illuminating region of the Bardeen black hole surrounded by PFDM is larger but the bright ring of the image is fainter. This provides a potential method for us to distinguish between classical Bardeen black holes and Bardeen black holes surrounded by PFDM.

Instead of the commonly used analytical power spectra, we compute the primordial power spectrum accurately by numerically solving the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation. Using the obtained power spectrum, we apply peak theory with $\\nabla^2 ζ$ treated as a Gaussian random field and parametrize the curvature profile by its amplitude $μ$ and characteristic width $K$. Confining the study to Type-I PBH, the threshold value is calculated using two robust methods: the average of the compaction function and the q-function method.

We present a critical re-analysis of GW190521 -- a short-duration, merger-dominated event with conflicting interpretations. Spin-aligned and precessing analyses at two ringdown start times show that precession induces modest but systematic shifts in inferred parameters and subdominant mode amplitudes, although such ringdown-only analyses provide no strong evidence for precession. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of physics-informed precessing ringdown modelling, paving the way for the identification of spin precession in gravitational-wave events using solely their ringdown stages, where waveform systematics are expected to be substantially less prominent."}

This apparent evidence, however, proves highly sensitive to the EoS assumptions: treating $w_{\\mathrm{de}}$ as a free parameter substantially weakens the evidence for interaction, with its value converging to the quintessence regime ($w_{\\mathrm{de}}>-1$). In contrast, freeing $w_{\\mathrm{dm}}$ maintains a preference for interaction, revealing a correlation where positive $w_{\\mathrm{dm}}$ is associated with energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter, and negative $w_{\\mathrm{dm}}$ with energy transfer from dark matter to dark energy.

In this paper, we intend to study the repetitive Penrose process in the Kerr-de Sitter (Kerr-dS) black hole. We will explore influences of the cosmological parameter on the repetitive Penrose process. The results show that, in addition to a similar third law of thermodynamics, the Kerr-dS black hole yields a higher energy return on investment (EROI) and single-extraction energy capability compared to the Kerr black hole. Specifically, the larger the cosmological parameter, the stronger the EROI and the single-extraction energy capability. Furthermore, we also find that at a lower decay radius, the Kerr black hole exhibits a higher energy utilization efficiency (EUE) and more extracted energy after the repetitive Penrose process is completed. However, at a higher decay radius, the situation is reversed, i.e., the Kerr-dS black hole exhibits a higher EUE and more extracted energy, which is due to the existence of stopping condition of the iteration."}

Many sources exhibit polarization signatures consistent with aligned dust grains, yet the physical origin of this alignment remains uncertain. One such source is BHB07-11, a Class I protobinary object in the Pipe Nebula with complex spiral arm structures in its circumbinary disk. While magnetic fields are often invoked to explain grain alignment in the interstellar medium, the contrasting conditions in circumstellar disk environments demand further investigation into grain alignment mechanisms. To determine BHB07-11's dominant polarization mechanism, we leverage ALMA polarization-mode dust continuum observations in Bands 3 ($λ$=3.1 mm), 6 ($λ$=1.3 mm), and 7 ($λ$=0.87 mm), in combination with high-resolution dust continuum and spectral line observations in Band 6. Observed polarization vectors in each band are consistent with emission from aligned grains and follow the structure of the spiral arms as shown in the high-resolution observations. Given the relationship between the observed polarization vector orientation and the spiral arms, we find that the polarization morphology is most consistent with grains aligned through a relative velocity flow between gas and dust in the spiral arms, as envisioned in the recently developed badminton birdie-like alignment mechanism, rather than alignment with a magnetic field or other known alignment mechanisms."}

Nonvanishing TLNs therefore provide a potential observational window into new physics. In this work, we present a unified and fully analytic study of the TLNs of three representative classes of regular black holes -- the Bardeen black hole,the black hole with sub-Planckian curvature, and the black hole arising in asymptotically safe gravity -- under scalar, vector, and axial gravitational perturbations. Employing a Green's function method combined with systematic perturbative expansions, we show that TLNs of regular black holes are generically nonzero and exhibit strong model and mode dependence. In many cases, higher-order corrections develop logarithmic scale dependence, closely resembling renormalization-group running in quantum field theory and revealing a scale-dependent tidal response absent in classical black holes. Our analysis demonstrates that the internal structure of regular black holes, including de Sitter or Minkowski cores and quantum-gravity-inspired modifications, leaves distinct fingerprints in their tidal properties. These results establish TLNs as promising probes for testing regular black hole models with future gravitational-wave observations."}

The 21-cm intensity field has a non-vanishing cross-correlation with the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect that traces the velocity and density perturbations of free electrons. By using the linear perturbation theory, in this paper we calculate analytically, for the first time, the cross-correlation between the squared kSZ field and the projection of the squared HI intensity mapping field with the flat-sky approximation. This statistic remains non-vanishing even after the long-wavelength line-of-sight modes ($k_{\\parallel}$) are removed due to foreground contamination. We further forecast for the prospects of detection with the SKA-MID 21-cm intensity mapping experiments (redshifts in range of $0.3 < z < 1$), and the kSZ maps measured by Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and Simons Observatory (SO). The predicted cumulative signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is $1.92$ for SKA-ACT and $3.99$ for SKA-SO. These results show a possible on-the-edge detection on the cross-correlation signal at low redshifts, which in turn could serve as a validation step towards using it for the Epoch of Reionization studies."}

The role of the quadrupole component of the potential, which at distances greater than 50 kpc is associated with the distribution of matter in the Galaxy's neighborhood (mainly with the influence of the galaxy M31), is studied. It is shown that perturbations of the potential created by the environment can significantly change the trajectories of particles at distances greater than 100 kpc from the Galactic center, but the magnitude of this effect depends on the still poorly known trajectory of the galaxy M31. For some variants of this trajectory, structures resembling a \"thin plane\" of satellite galaxies cannot exist for more than 2-3 billion years."}

When dark sector EoS are fixed to $w_{\\mathrm{de}}=-1$ and $w_{\\mathrm{dm}}=0$, the data consistently favor an energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter across various interaction forms. This apparent evidence, however, proves highly sensitive to the EoS assumptions: treating $w_{\\mathrm{de}}$ as a free parameter substantially weakens the evidence for interaction, with its value converging to the quintessence regime ($w_{\\mathrm{de}}>-1$). In contrast, freeing $w_{\\mathrm{dm}}$ maintains a preference for interaction, revealing a correlation where positive $w_{\\mathrm{dm}}$ is associated with energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter, and negative $w_{\\mathrm{dm}}$ with energy transfer from dark matter to dark energy. These findings caution against the simplistic assumption of $Λ$CDM EoS values when attempting to detect a possible interaction. Despite these fundamental degeneracies, model comparison using the Akaike and Deviance information criteria shows that all of the tested interacting dark energy scenarios receive substantial support over the $Λ$CDM model."}

On scales below the nDGP crossover scale $r_{\\rm c}$, the nDGP model features an effective gravity-like fifth force that alters the growth of structure, leading to an enhancement of the halo mass function (HMF) on cluster scales. The enhanced cluster abundance allows for constraints on the nDGP model using cluster samples. We employ the SPT cluster sample, selected through the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (tSZE) with the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and with mass calibration using weak-lensing data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The cluster sample contains 1,005 clusters with redshifts $0.25 < z < 1.78$, which are confirmed with the Multi-Component Matched Filter (MCMF) algorithm using optical and near-infrared data. Weak-lensing data from DES and HST enable a robust mass measurement of the cluster sample. We use DES Year 3 data for 688 clusters with redshifts $z < 0.95$, and HST data for 39 clusters with redshifts $ 0.6 < z <1.7$. We account for the enhancement in the HMF through a semi-analytic correction factor to the $νΛ$CDM HMF derived from the spherical collapse model in the nDGP model. We then further calibrate this model using $N$-body simulations. In addition, for the first time, we analyze the primary cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements from Planck PR4 within the nDGP model. We obtain a competitive constraint from the joint analysis of the SPT cluster abundance with the Planck PR4 data, and report an upper bound of $1/\\sqrt{H_0r_{\\rm c}}< 1.41$ at $95\\%$ when assuming a cosmology with massive neutrinos."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "OB associations are primordial tracers of star formation and Galactic structure. Originally defined about 80 years ago, their historical membership lists have been superseded thanks to the precise astrometry from ESA's \\textit{Gaia}'s satellite. Recent studies have however been mostly focused on individual OB associations or limited by the coverage of spectroscopic surveys. In this paper, we exploit a complete census of $\\sim$25,000 O- and B-type stars within 1 kpc of the Sun to produce a highly-reliable catalogue of 57 OB associations using the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm, increasing the number of known OB associations by a factor of two within this volume. We assess the validity of this catalogue by crossmatching our OB association members with other catalogues of OB associations, star clusters and young stellar groups, confirming the high-confidence of our census of OB associations. We characterize these OB associations physically (total initial stellar mass, number of OB stars, ...) and kinematically (velocity dispersion, linear expansion ages, ...). Nearly three quarters of the OB associations (41 out of 57) exhibit a significant expansion pattern in at least one direction, including 13 in both plane-of-the-sky directions, though differences in expansion velocity suggest anisotropical expansion patterns. We compare the locations of these OB associations with superclouds and features in the local Milky Way such as the Radcliffe Wave and discuss the implications for star formation in the solar neighbourhood."}

Building on a generalised Press & Schechter model and triaxial collapse (GPS+), we predict the HMF in terms of the variance of the linear density field, with only a weak explicit dependence on halo mass and no explicit dependence on redshift. The GPS+ model naturally provides the correct normalization and high-mass behaviour without requiring empirical fitting. We calibrate and validate the GPS+ model using the Uchuu N-body simulation suite, which combines large cosmological volume and high mass resolution under Planck cosmology. Using six simulations with up to 300 realizations, we obtain precision HMF measurements spanning halo masses in the range 6.5 < log($M_{\\rm 200m}$/[h$^{-1}$ $M_{\\odot}$]) <16 over 0 < z < 20, with reduced cosmic variance. Across this full domain, the GPS+ model reproduces the simulated HMF with deviations typically below 10-20%. Comparison with the Sheth-Tormen (ST) model shows similar performance at z < 2, but markedly improved agreement at higher redshifts, where ST can deviate by 70-80% while our model remains within ~20%. Finally, we assess the impact of the halo mass definition: adopting the evolving virial overdensity of Bryan & Norman (1998) worsens agreement at low redshift and high masses, whereas M200m yields a more universal, nearly redshift-independent HMF."}

It has recently been claimed based on dynamical arguments that perfectly cored stellar systems cannot survive inside cuspy dark matter halos, which would make the observation of stellar cores in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, where dark matter cores cannot form through baryonic processes, a direct falsification of the cold dark matter paradigm. Here, we use idealized simulations to show explicitly that cored stellar systems like those observed in dwarf galaxies can be stable within cuspy dark matter halos over at least several Hubble times. We also demonstrate that observations of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies cannot distinguish mildly positive, flat, or negative inner density slopes, further precluding the dynamical inference of the gravitational potential from the stellar configuration."}

The ALMAGAL project observed $\\sim1000$ clumps at $\\sim$1000\\,au resolution, enabling a statistically significant characterization of this process across a large range of clump physical parameters and evolutionary stages. In this work, we investigated the spatial distribution of dense cores in the 514 massive, potentially cluster-forming, clumps hosting at least 4 cores, to trace fragmentation's initial conditions and early evolution. We used quantitative descriptors, evaluated against the clump bolometric luminosity-to-mass ratio as an indicator of evolution. Core separations were measured with the minimum spanning tree method (MST) and compared with the Jeans gravitational fragmentation theory. We used the $Q$ parameter and the mass segregation ratio, $Λ_{MSR}$, to evaluate whether cores have specific arrangements or differences depending on their masses. ALMAGAL cores are usually arranged in elliptical groups with an axis ratio $e\\sim2.2$, but $e\\geq$5 is also observed. A single characteristic core separation per clump is found in $\\sim76$% of cases, but signatures of multiple fragmentation lengths not rare. Typical core separations are compatible with the clump-averaged thermal Jeans length, $λ^{th}_{J}$, though a population, typical of low-fragmented/young clumps, has wider separations with $l\\approx3\\timesλ^{th}_{J}$. The core separation decreases on average from $l\\sim22000$ au in younger systems to $l\\sim7000$ au in more evolved ones. Cores are typically distributed in fractal-type subclusters, with centrally concentrated patterns appearing only at later stages, but without a progressive evolutionary transition. Finally, mass segregation is found in 110 systems, with its occurrence increasing with evolution."}
